But the lack of queues may have been down to the online lottery scheme introduced by Apple to prevent a repeat of January's chaos. It used the same method earlier this month for the launch of its iPad mini, and enforced a two-per-person limit.</p><p>Although the company has 300,000 pre-orders for the phone from China Unicom, one of the three big mobile providers, and will also sell it through mobile company China Telecom, it has still not sealed a deal with China Mobile, the biggest player with 703 million users of whom 79m are 3G (ie smartphone) users. Despite years of talks, the two sides have disagreed on revenue splits and business models.</p><p>That means Apple is unable to increase its shipments there as fast as the market for smartphones is growing. There are already 290 million smartphone users and that is forecast to double in the next 12 months.</p><p>Nokia's shares rose earlier this month after it tied up a deal to sell its Lumia smartphones through China Mobile.</p><p>Even so, China Mobile announced in March that an estimated 15 million people use iPhones on its network, despite their being incompatible with its data services.</p><p>More broadly, But Apple and Nokia are struggling in the face of competition from devices powered by versions of Google's Android software: those make up roughly 90% of the smartphones sold in China, although many connect to Chinese services rather than Google's.</p><p>"In absolute terms, this (iPhone 5) launch will certainly result in strong sales for Apple in China. However, in relative terms, I don't believe it will move the needle enough in market share," Shiv Putcha, a Mumbai-based analyst at Ovum, a global technology consultant, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Peter Misek of Jefferies said he was lowering his iPhone shipment estimates for the first quarter of 2013 by 5m to 48m, on the basis that the company was cutting orders to suppliers. He also cut his estimates for the company's gross margins by 2 percentage points, to 40%. He said it was unclear how much the snowy weather and requirement to pre-order were factors in the small queues.</p><p>That seems to have helped push down Apple shares, which have lost a quarter of their value since hitting an all-time high of $705.07 on 21 September.</p><p>Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS Research, told clients in a research note that he didn't expect the iPhone 5 to do as well in China as the iPhone 4S. The brokerage cuts its price target for Apple's stock to $700, substantially down from $780, on the expectation of lower iPhone and iPad shipments in the first quarter of 2013.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/iphone-5">iPhone 5</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china">China</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple">Apple</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones">Mobile phones</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/telecoms">Telecoms</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/smartphones">Smartphones</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur">Charles Arthur</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

David Cameron had indicated as recently as last month that he wanted firms to follow the lead of TalkTalk, which was the first big name internet service provider to introduce network-level filtering of websites for its customers.</p><p>The report, released with little fanfare on Friday, said: "It is... clear that in accepting that responsibility, parents want to be in control, and that it would be easier for them to use the online safety tools available to them if they could learn more about those tools.</p><p>"They also want information about internet safety risks and what to do about them. There was no great appetite among parents for the introduction of default filtering of the internet by their ISP: only 35 percent of the parents who responded favoured that approach. There were even smaller proportions of parents who favoured an approach which simply asked them what they would like their children to access on the internet, with no default settings (13 percent) or a system that combines the latter approach with default filtering(15 percent)," the report said.</p><p>The Daily Mail has led a campaign against children's access to pornography. The newspaper suggested last month that Cameron was about to call for a tightening up of parental controls online.</p><p>It is understood that ISPs and advocacy groups have fought a fierce lobbying campaign to face down the measures. The campaign for greater curbs against online porn had been led by the Tory MP Claire Perry, who chaired the independent inquiry into online child protection in April.</p><p>The industry responded by saying that Perry's plans were unworkable. But Cameron's aides then widely briefed that the government was considering the introduction of new filters for online pornography.</p><p>Although internet regulation has consistently proved a sensitive topic for UK governments, the wide availability of pornography has concerned MPs from all political parties.</p><p>Labour's shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman appeared to back the No 10 consultation, saying in a statement that protecting children online was a real problem and a concern for millions of parents.</p><p>The Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA) welcomed the move. "Online safety is a shared responsibility between parents and the wider industry, including ISPs, manufacturers and retailers, via providing easy to use tools, advice and information," the lobby group's secretary general Nick Lansman told a website.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/pornography">Pornography</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet">Internet</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/education">Education policy</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal">Rajeev Syal</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A car for the budget, not for the heart</p><p>I enjoy a car with a sarcastic name. Like a Mitsubishi Carisma, a vehicle with the charisma of a potato. Or a&nbsp;Rover Streetwise, which, despite its attempts to look tough, is clearly a Rover 25 underneath – a cowering, curtain-twitching old granny of a car. Or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Suzuki Swift, which isn't. Isn't swift, I mean.</p><p>Nor is a Skoda Rapid rapid. The entry-level, 1.2-litre, three-cylinder petrol-engine model must be spectacularly unrapid. This one I'm trying, the 1.6 diesel, is actually&nbsp;perfectly adequate, so long as you don't expect any thrills. Or frills. That's what this is – an adequate, honest, sensible, no-nonsense, good-value family motor, a&nbsp;European rival to the cars that come out of Korea. With a very large boot for its size.</p><p>We took it to Devon for the weekend and it easily swallowed two adults' and one baby's going-out-of-town paraphernalia (pretty much everything we possess – you never know what you're not going to&nbsp;find in the countryside), with room to spare.</p><p>And it got us there and back safely, and comfortably (though not luxuriously), on a tank of diesel, without damaging the planet too much. And... and that's about it. The car simply didn't become a character in the drama of the weekend, in either a good way or bad.</p><p>It certainly didn't make much of an emotional impact on my girlfriend. Regular readers of this column (ha!) will know she's not exactly a petrolhead, but she'll usually come up with something, at a push. Not this time. I honestly think she didn't notice it.</p><p>Spoilt cow, you might think, and you'd be right. But to be fair to her (I'm full of fairness today), it really isn't very noticeable. It's a shame because Skodas can be quite interestingly designed (I'm mainly thinking about the likable – unabominable? – Yeti). But this one is instantly forgettable. Go on, you've seen the picture, now look away... See? You've instantly forgotten what it looks like.</p><p>Inside it's the same story: dullsville. Poor Simon, the photographer. He really struggled to find an interesting detail for the little interesting detail picture. It all works and makes sense, but nothing stands out.</p><p>No one's going to buy a Skoda Rapid because they've fallen in love with it; they're going to buy it because the numbers make sense. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. It's a car for the budget, not for the heart; a means of getting from A to B, without excitement, or joy, or anything else, really.</p><p>It is in short – and unsarcastically – a Skoda Vapid.</p><h2>Skoda Rapid 1.6 TDI</h2><p><strong>Price </strong>£17,100 <br /><strong>Top speed</strong> 118mph <br /><strong>Acceleration</strong> 0-62 in 10.4 seconds <br /><strong>Combined fuel consumption</strong> 64.2mpg <br /><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</strong> 114g/km<br /><strong>Eco rating</strong> 7/10 <br /><strong>Cool rating </strong>1/10</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/motoring">Motoring</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samwollaston">Sam Wollaston</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Its motorway network will soon rival America's. But while the rich splash out on Porsches and Ferraris, resentment is growing among the have-nots</p><p>It is half a century since Zhang Jing's father impressed the neighbours with a mark of his family's rising fortunes. He was the first in the village to acquire a bicycle; like Ford's Model T, the Forever came in any colour you liked, as long as it was black. Though America was deep in the golden age of the automobile, those days lay so far ahead for China that small boys would loiter on street corners in Beijing, waiting until a car drove by and the exotic tang of petrol fumes filled their nostrils. Even by the early 1980s, glimpses of imported Soviet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lada" title="">Ladas</a> or stately Chinese<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongqi_%28automobile%29" title=""> Red Flag</a> saloons were rare outside the capital.</p><p>"We never dreamed we would have a chance to have our own car… and not only one," Zhang's husband, Wang Junfang, says.</p><p>China's love affair with cars began late, but it has more than made up for the delay. In 2000 there were 4m cars for the 1.3bn population and experts predicted that the number would be six times higher by the end of the decade. Instead, it soared 20-fold. Two years ago, the country became the world's largest new car market. This year, it should see about 18m sales, against 14.5m in the US. The kingdom of bicycles is now the land of the car.</p><p>Michael Dunne, whose firm <a href="http://dunneandcompany.com/" title="">Dunne & Company</a> advises on investments in the Asian automobile industry, calls it car culture with Chinese characteristics. People are looking for freedom and convenience, but "it's different from the US experience – open highways, rolling down your windows, putting music on," he says. "In China, it's more about social status: look at me, look at my&nbsp;new car. It's much more about the thrill you get from pulling up in front of your hotel or golf club or workplace and being seen and recognised."</p><p>Zhang and her husband – a fresh-faced, sporty couple in their early 30s – have already added a&nbsp;Peugot 206 to their 4x4 Subaru Forester. "Families want different cars for different uses," she explains. "One for daily use, one for weekends." The bigger Subaru is ideal for getting out of the city so that Wang can fish or the pair can ride their bikes together, they say. The Peugeot&nbsp;is fine, too, and only a few years old. But they like the idea of getting something newer and hipper, so they have come to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_%28marque%29" title="">Mini</a> showroom. The Mini "looks very cool and quite British, and this brand has been bought by BMW, so we trust its quality," Wang says. "And, of course, we like the personalisation aspect. We want to add stripes after we buy it, and colourful paintwork."</p><p>They have plenty of choice as they stroll through the vast new Mini emporium in west Beijing. The store spans 9,000 square metres across two floors, with espresso points and a&nbsp;miniature Zen garden. There's a pool table beneath the scrawled command BE SEXY – BE MINI and giant copies of Andy Warhol's Marilyn and Mao portraits lean against a wall. Around the floor, potential buyers settle into the seats of Coopers and Countrymen, while returning owners ponder new ways to distinguish their cars. One motorist shows off the chequerboard roof, racing stripes and new wing-mirror covers that he's added; he is disappointed that there is, as yet, no checked glove compartment cover for his model.</p><p>At 220,000 to 400,000 yuan – £22,000 to £40,000 – the cars are a hefty investment in a city where last year the average income was about 33,000 yuan. Wang and Zhang are teachers, but still live with his parents and have had a little help from relatives. Being a two-car couple seems natural to them.</p><p>In fact, the Mini showroom looks restrained in a land that boasts almost a million dollar-millionaires. Gleaming Lamborghinis, Tramontanas and Porsches park in front of malls or screech along expressways in late-night races, prompting admiration, envy and resentment, but little surprise these days. Sky-high taxes on high-end imports have proved little deterrent; the Maserati Quattroporte, at upwards of 2.2m yuan, is the vehicle of choice for ladies who lunch.</p><p>Last month, 130 Ferraris, mostly as red as the Chinese flag, paraded through the streets of Guangzhou in a celebration of the brand's 20 years in the country. When Rolls-Royce launched a $1.2m Year of the Dragon edition of its Phantom, with the creature hand-painted on its wheelbase and hand-stitched on to cushions, all eight sold in two months.</p><p>Car firms throughout the price spectrum have come to depend on Chinese buyers. "There is no way to overstate how much foreign companies have become reliant on sustaining success in the Chinese market," says Dunne, who is also author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Wheels-Chinese-Roads-General/dp/0470828617" title="">American Wheels, Chinese Roads: The Story Of General Motors In China</a>. "For GM, Hyundai, Nissan, Volkswagen, Audi, it's already the number one car market in the world. Take China out of their portfolio and their fortunes would reverse."</p><p>Some believe that the US – the land of Route 66, T-Birds and American Graffiti – has reached "peak car"; the number of miles driven per person has fallen in recent years. But no one doubts that plenty of room remains in the world's second largest economy, even as its GDP growth cools. In the US, there are around 600 cars per 1,000 people, against a global average of 135, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. In China? Just 44.</p><p>When a report from the management consultants McKinsey warned of slowing growth in the car market in China, it was predicting an 8% annual increase in the near future. That may be a substantial fall from the 24% of recent years – but given the size of the existing market, it should not prove too painful for car firms.</p><p>The government has encouraged car sales as part of the Chinese dream. "The Chinese customer really wants a better life," says Arthur Wang, of McKinsey's Shanghai office, "and when they consider that, they have a house, they have a&nbsp;car." Officials are thinking about the economic benefits. Car manufacturing has a powerful multiplier effect compared with other sectors, fuelling steel production and other industries and, at the other end of the chain, a&nbsp;growing number of dealerships.</p><p>Meanwhile, officials have used infrastructure construction to shore up GDP figures and promote development across the country. If Beijing's six ring roads are striking, the national network's expansion is more so. In 2000, there were 16,000km (11,000 miles) of expressway, according to state media; by 2009 that had reached 65,000 and by 2020 there will be 100,000km, roughly similar to the US.</p><p>But, Dunne notes, there is now "a bit of a political dilemma" for the government. "It really likes the fact that 95% of cars on the road are built here, thanks to very high tariffs on imported cars. It&nbsp;means investment in factories, jobs, tax revenues. On the other hand, [it is] suddenly confronted with the potential risks to national security in that it is more than ever reliant on imported oil. How do you feed this monster? And the environment is incredibly important, especially to younger Chinese. The government is saying it will tolerate the problems because it wants the motor industry. But it's not an open-and-shut case. They are saying: we have to manage this, because it's big and it could get out of hand."</p><p>China is roughly the same size as the US, but its population is four times bigger, and the downsides of car growth are already obvious. In 2011 alone, 62,387 people were killed on the roads, according to the police. Although those figures show the toll declining from a peak in 2002, other researchers question the data and the downwards trend. In 2007, they point out, police recorded 81,649 deaths on the roads, whereas death registrations suggested that crashes killed 221,135.</p><p>Cars have also come to symbolise what is worst, as well as best, about the country's breakneck development. For China it is a love-hate relationship, with an ambivalence apparently lacking in America's automobile addiction. Cars have become inextricably associated with corruption and the abuse of power; greed and materialism; environmental devastation; perhaps, above all, the growing gulf between the rich and the rest. Anger erupts when wealthy boy racers mow down less privileged pedestrians. Gossip is rife about luxury models registered to official work units or driven by cadres' relatives. Many believe that a leading politician's hopes of promotion were destroyed this year when his son was involved in a fatal Ferrari accident. When I&nbsp;passed a luxury car crash in Beijing this spring, an old man who had stopped to stare muttered, "It would be better if rich people just died."</p><p>Regular motorists moan about the arrogance and bullying behaviour of those in more expensive cars, especially those with official plates. (Not all of these may be genuine: past crackdowns have netted vast numbers of fake military registrations.) People may not care about their own contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and the effect of rising temperatures and sea levels, as policy-makers do. But they notice when their children choke on smog and they grumble when they inch along because their route to work is clogged by other motorists. When the media group Bloomberg held a race across the capital last month, a bicycle reached the finish line in half an hour – 22 minutes quicker than the Porsche.</p><p>Even two-car households often spurn the western one-vehicle-one-user model on practical grounds, as Zhang explains. "The traffic is so bad, we drive one car and he will drop me off halfway so I can get the subway," she says. "It's more efficient than taking two cars to work."</p><p>The problems are becoming so bad that Beijing has banned motorists from driving one day a&nbsp;week and limited new car registrations through a lottery system. In 2010, some 790,000 cars were added to the capital's roads – more than 2,000 a day. But officials say only 173,000 were added last year – the first slowdown in growth since 1984. Even that, they think, is not enough of a reduction. In October they said they would consider ordering odd- and even-numbered licence plates to drive at alternate times in specific areas. Shanghai has also taken action and Guangzhou hopes that similar measures will halve the number of new vehicles. Chongqing, a south-western metropolis, has discussed introducing a congestion charge.</p><p>Arthur Wang of McKinsey says 15 or 20 cities are likely to reach the congestion levels that prompt such policy changes over the next five years. But most car growth is in small cities and newly urbanising areas, and he sees little prospect of national controls.</p><p>Deborah Gordon, co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Billion-Cars-Driving-Sustainability/dp/0199737231/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1354724257&sr=1-1" title="">Two Billion Cars</a> and an associate with the <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/programs/global/index.cfm?fa=proj&id=108" title="">energy and climate programme</a> at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says Chinese authorities should seize their chance to curb car usage. Instead, they would be advised to focus on better-designed cities, improved public transport, more efficient cars and more electric or hybrid vehicles. "When economic growth was double-digit in recent years, policy-makers were having a&nbsp;hard time keeping up with rapid changes in motorisation," Gordon says. "They have a golden opportunity now to shape future growth without disrupting it during the economic downturn. If China grows to accommodate autos as the priority form of mobility, it will be very difficult and expensive to reverse these investments."</p><p>On a cold late autumn afternoon, shoppers wander the rows of the Huaxiang secondhand car market in south-western Beijing. The city's air is thick with fumes. Buildings loom out of the haze and the sun glows an apocalyptic red. According to local officials, motor vehicles account for about half the capital's air pollution. Clusters of men play Chinese chess and puff on cigarettes under the pearl-coloured sky. Women stamp their feet to keep warm as they swipe at cars with miniature mops; even a boxy, retro-looking Chang'an estate shines as if fresh from the production line.</p><p>Zhang Penghao is in search of his first&nbsp;car, without a great deal of enthusiasm. Despite his friendly smile, his eyes are gloomy behind his heavy glasses. "Actually, it's not worth it. There are too many cars and limited roads," the 24-year-old complains. Driving to his job at a hotel would take longer than using the subway; he will reserve the car for visiting friends in the suburbs and, more importantly, for dates. "In China, if you don't have a house or car, you can't get a wife. There's a&nbsp;lot of pressure." His only reason for buying a vehicle is to improve his eligibility. "If a&nbsp;girl can see you didn't drive to pick her up, she won't bother coming out. I don't understand why it's so&nbsp;important, either. It's women, or really the women's parents, who care."</p><p>It is no coincidence that the soundbite that has come to sum up modern Chinese&nbsp;materialism centres on a car. When a dating show contestant rebuffed an impecunious suitor with the words, "I&nbsp;would rather cry in the back of a BMW than laugh on the back of a bicycle", they instantly became part of popular lore.</p><p>Chinese motorists know they must impress, whether they are seeking partners for romance or business. Roll up in an Audi and you ensure a basic degree of respect. Arrive in a domestic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chery_QQ" title="">Chery QQ</a> hatchback and you are doomed before you get through a client's door. "People don't really think about whether they need a car, but feel they have to have one to show their status," Zhang's friend Zhao Cihang tells me at the Mini showroom. Until recently he edited a car website and, although he is a year younger than Zhang, already owns two BMWs, an Audi and a Honda. But, he adds, "I still think about new ones. I'd like&nbsp;an SUV – the biggest kind."</p><p>SUVs are one of the fastest-growing sectors, thanks to buyers such as Zhao, who see them as smarter than saloons. But Dunne thinks there is something more to the passion for SUVs: "It's symbolic of the aspiration to project the image of a free spirit… They may not use the vehicles off-road, but they want to say: I am an explorer."</p><p>Last year, Zhang and her husband drove to Shanghai, a journey of almost 800 miles that is more easily and comfortably covered by plane or&nbsp;high-speed rail. The drive was the point; though they could have afforded hotels, they slept in the Subaru overnight. They speak enviously of the motorhomes they glimpsed on a European holiday. "We hope the younger generation, our generation, can think of cars as a symbol of freedom and use them for travel, so&nbsp;they're not just about achievement and social status," Zhang says.</p><p>For a handful of educated urban consumers, cars are no longer simply a sign of how much they have earned, how good their taste is or how suitable for marriage they may be. They are a&nbsp;hint of their inner yearnings, a sign that one day, perhaps, motoring might become embedded in China's culture as it has in the US, the other great nation of the automobile.</p><p>Though highways stretch out across the country, there are as yet no road movies. Young men and women cruise around town, but no anthems celebrate today's Chinese equivalent of a T-bird. The Mini dealership's manager enthuses about the ability of cars to express their owner's individuality. But asked if Chinese authors or musicians might one day celebrate automobiles as Americans have, she looks bewildered. "Things like washing machines and refrigerators are part of our life in China, but we don't really have songs about them," she explains politely. "We don't think because refrigerators are popular that maybe someone has to write a book about them."</p><p>• Additional research by Cecily Huang</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china">China</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/automotive-industry">Automotive industry</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/motoring">Motoring</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan">Tania Branigan</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But from Wednesday the Sheffield-based broadband company is allowing new and existing customers on its basic deal to upgrade to an unlimited service for an extra £4 a month.</p><p>The service will appeal to users making greater use&nbsp;of data-heavy services such as BBC&nbsp;iPlayer and other on-demand media applications. It will also be welcomed by those in rural areas who are more likely to only have two reasonably priced broadband options – BT and Plusnet.</p><p>Plusnet will launch unlimited broadband on both copper and fibre products. Plusnet Unlimited will provide up to 16Mbps at £4.99 a month for the first 12 months for new customers who take its home phone package, and £9.99 thereafter.</p><p>Existing customers who want to stay on the cheaper capped 10GB service can do so and will continue to pay £5.99 a month. Those who want to upgrade to the unlimited service will pay £9.99 a month.</p><p>Meanwhile, its superfast option, Plusnet Unlimited Fibre, which offers speeds of up to 76Mbps, is available at £9.99 a month for the first six months if you take its home phone package. This will rise to £19.99 a month after six months.</p><p>Plusnet Essentials Fibre will start from £7.99 a month for six months when you take the home phone deal, rising to £15.99 a month thereafter. This is still a capped product, limited to 40GB a month.</p><p>In making the "unlimited" move the company has brought itself into line with other big providers such as Sky, which already offer uncapped services.</p><p>Jamie Ford, Plusnet's chief executive officer, says: "Customers' internet habits have changed considerably over the past 12 months. People are using more bandwidth and services that demand faster speeds. But at the same time we know some people still want a broadband supply for limited day-to-day use at the best price possible. We believe our new Essentials and Unlimited products meet either demand."</p><p>In recent years the company has made much of the fact its call centres are in Sheffield rather than Asia, which anyone who has called BT recently might value. It has also done well in customer satisfaction surveys and is a Which? "best buy".</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/internetphonesbroadband">Internet, phones & broadband</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/household-bills">Household bills</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs">Consumer affairs</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/broadband">Broadband</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet">Internet</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/telecoms">Telecoms</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/telecoms">Telecommunications industry</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/milesbrignall">Miles Brignall</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It will also cover allegations that the Barclays, who have built a castle on the Channel Isles tax haven of Sark, are trying to take over control of the island and its 600 inhabitants.</p><p>Davie's decision to broadcast an investigative programme about the controversial and frequently litigious Barclay twins comes at a fraught time for BBC executives. His predecessor, Entwistle, was forced to resign weeks into his new job, following successive scandals at Newsnight. Two inquiry reports are currently overdue at the BBC, on editorial decisions first to suppress a programme correctly exposing the late Jimmy Savile as a sex abuser, and secondly to put out a programme that falsely accused the former Tory treasurer Alistair McAlpine of similar crimes.</p><p>Panorama's filming attracted denunciation and complaints from the Barclays' estate manager on Sark, who some islanders suggest is a spokesman for the brothers. Kevin Delaney, apparently getting his retaliation in first, wrote a lengthy article in October criticising the BBC in his Sark Newsletter. Referring to the Savile case, he said the BBC was "a deeply flawed and dysfunctional organisation that has failed miserably in its self-regulation". Sweeney had visited Sark on three occasions in the autumn, he said, accusing the journalist of "unbecoming drunken antics at the pub", including falling off his bicycle.</p><p></p><p>"Empowered by the might of the BBC, Mr Sweeney filmed people without their consent. He aggressively invaded my offices and harassed and intimidated my staff in his concerted efforts at staging a hostile confrontation with me on camera - despite being made aware, in writing, that I did not want to be interviewed by him."</p><p>Sweeney has previously been sued by the Barclays in the 1990s after he was filmed landing on their island of Brecqhou, next to Sark. Both the journalist and John Birt, the then director general, were sued by the twins in France, and after a lengthy legal action Sweeney was ordered to pay 20,000 francs in damages by a court in Rennes.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc">BBC</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/barclay-brothers">Barclay Brothers</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/dailytelegraph">Daily Telegraph</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing">Newspapers & magazines</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/national-newspapers">National newspapers</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/timdavie">Tim Davie</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers">Newspapers</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidleigh">David Leigh</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The famous trophy – a silver-plated camera on a tripod with the name of each winner engraved on individual shields attached to the plinth – has always been prestigious. But never more so than in 2012, a year of unprecedented sporting success.</p><p>In the year that London hosted the Olympics and Paralympics, Britain far exceeded its medal expectations. So Jessica Ennis raced to a glorious gold in the heptathlon, Ellie Simmonds won four Paralympic medals in the pool, Mo Farah became the first Brit to win the 5,000m and 10,000m double, David Weir sprinted to four wheelchair golds, Ben Ainslie clinched his fourth consecutive sailing gold, Chris Hoy became Britain's most successful Olympian with six golds, Nicola Adams became our first ever female boxing champion, and on it went. There was a time in August when David Bowie's Heroes seemed to ring out on an hourly basis over east London.</p><p>This was also the year Andy Murray became the first British man to win a tennis grand slam in 76 years (not forgetting his Olympic gold) and Rory Mcllroy won the USA PGA championship by a record eight strokes. In most years any of these feats would have been enough to win the award. But not 2012. According to the bookies the overwhelming favourite is Bradley Wiggins, first Brit to win the hideously tough Tour de France, who followed up with Olympic gold in the time trial. Jessica Ennis, poster girl for the Olympics and fifth in Google's top 10 trending people for 2012, is third favourite with most bookies.</p><p>There is no money attached to the unappealingly acronymed Spoty, but there is a load of kudos. Voted for by the public, it is the ultimate recognition for any sportsman or woman. It can appear unseemly for candidates to be seen to be overtly presidential about campaigning – pressing flesh, kissing babies, begging for votes – but make no mistake they want to win.</p><p>It's at this time of year that any number of interviews with candidates appear when they have nothing obvious to sell apart from their sincerity.</p><p><strong>Campaigning</strong></p><p>A couple of weeks ago Mo Farah was on the road trying to get a Christmas number one with his Do the Mobot single, championing his charity, and mentioning to anybody who'd listen how much he'd love to win Spoty. "It would mean so much to win it," he said. "It would be massive, of course it would." We could have a contract put out on Wiggins, I suggested to the second favourite. He grinned. "Nah, it's just up to the public. As an athlete I did what I had to do, and that's it. Then the phone lines are open."</p><p>Perhaps the most brazen campaigner was Kelly Holmes back in 2004 after she won double gold in Athens. Eight years ago I interviewed her when she was on the final run-in to being named Spoty. Vote, vote, vote for Holmes – she made no bones about it. Ostensibly, she was promoting her book, but really the only thing of interest to her was winning Spoty. "It's the greatest honour a sportsperson can be given in the country. So for me to win that would just top off my year completely," she said at the time. "If you think my two gold medals and years and years of dedication are worth voting for, then I'll be very grateful," she told me in no uncertain terms. As we parted, she rammed home her message. "Don't-for-get-to-vote-for-me," she said, poking me in the chest with each syllable.</p><p>"Bradley campaigning? You've got to be joking," laughed his agent, Jonathan Marks. After all, Wiggo's reputation rests on his cool. "I think he'd break our knees if he thought we were actively campaigning for him because it's so opposed to what he innately believes in; you do it on merit. He'd feel desperately uncomfortable if there was a sense of the public being coerced or manipulated. And sometimes it can be quite ugly." In what way? "A lot of campaigning is done by commercial partners. If you're enhancing an asset you've bought into you can see why they do it. But Bradley's only commercial partner is Fred Perry, and it's not really their style." Having said that, Marks added, Wiggins would love to win.</p><p>Many all-time greats have won Spoty – from England's World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore to Henry Cooper, Sebastian Coe, Ian Botham, Daley Thompson, Steve Redgrave and Andrew Flintoff. Sometimes the award throws up surprises, not least when the winners are notably lacking in personality. Cooper is one of three two-time winners – the others are dullish Formula One drivers Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill.</p><p>RBS has sponsored Andy Murray since he was 13. Media manager David Gaffney said the bank might have been more keen on making capital out of Spoty a few years ago, but not any more. "Post-bailout we changed the way we did sponsorship. We thought it wasn't right for us to spend loads of money promoting a brand. In bygone days, we might have lobbied and seen it as opportunity to get brand exposure. The bank was growing aggressively, and we were looking for global profile. Andy was useful because he was a globally recognised athlete, achieving on world scale."</p><p>Today, said Gaffney, RBS's branding would have more humility to it. So Murray's campaign is about working at grassroots in the community with his programme Set For Sport. "Everything we do now is about getting kids and parents to visit the website." If Murray won, Gaffney said, it would be great for RBS, but not in a way it could or would want to monetise. "The metrics by which we judge success is by how many people participate rather than increased global exposure."</p><p>When jockey AP McCoy was shortlisted for Spoty two years ago, the racing industry got right behind him. Racing For Change, a body set up to boost awareness of racing among the non-racing public, campaigned ferociously. "Racing had never won in Sports Personality of the Year's 56-year history at that time, and we thought it should," said spokesman Nick Attenborough. The first thing Racing For Change did was encourage the Spoty panel to nominate him. "We tried to educate them about why McCoy was so special; we wanted to show how somebody who has ridden 3,000 winners, starves himself to death every day and has broken pretty much every bone in his body is extraordinary. Then the next thing we had to do was convince the public to vote for him."</p><p>How did it do that? "We printed lifesize cardboard cutouts of him and put them on racecourses, and there was a sash on it saying 'Vote McCoy'. Small quirky things like that. Ladbroke's did a viral email campaign, and one or two racecourses took unsponsored races on telly and called them 'Vote McCoy Handicap Stakes". Did it have a knock-on effect? "We certainly think so. The following year's Grand National had an extra million viewers, and racecourse attendances were a record last year."</p><p>For Dominic Curran, deputy managing director of sponsorship agency Synergy, the main value of winning Spoty is for the individual rather than the industry or sponsor. After all, once you win it you're up there with the best.</p><p>"The show is something we grew up with, something you remember watching when you were a kid. Sports people themselves are often the greatest historian of their own discipline. One of the things winners always do when they pick it up is look at previous winners. That must be such a moment, being there with your own heroes. So I think its value is more in personal branding than for commercial reasons."</p><p>Multiple Paralympic medallist Ellie Simmonds said she couldn't wait for Sunday night – being at London's ExCel centre for the live televised show with friends and fellow achievers, celebrating their special year. "There are three Paralympians in the top 12. That is incredible. It's never happened before." What would it mean if a Paralympian won? "Everything. It would show we were up there with the Olympics."</p><p>Had she been campaigning? "British Swimming are doing stuff; they are putting the hashtag #voteforellie on Twitter." If she won, she said, she's bound to embarrass herself by crying. "I'm so emotional, it's awful." But, she said, that's getting ahead of herself. She's convinced that Wiggins will win. "My choice would be Bradley because of what he's done. Tour de France is so gruelling, winning it so hard, and he's the first Brit. Then coming to a home Olympic games and the expectation to get gold and he did. Amazing. And he's got a great personality."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year">BBC Sports Personality of the Year</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc">BBC</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/jessica-ennis">Jessica Ennis</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/nicola-adams">Nicola Adams</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/ainslie">Ben Ainslie</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/mo-farah">Mo Farah</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/chrishoy">Sir Chris Hoy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/rory-mcilroy">Rory McIlroy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/andymurray">Andy Murray</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/eleanor-simmonds">Ellie Simmonds</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/sarah-storey">Sarah Storey</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/david-weir">David Weir</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/bradleywiggins">Bradley Wiggins</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympics-2012">Olympic Games 2012</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simonhattenstone">Simon Hattenstone</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I've read the Guardian daily since university 15 years ago when I was drawn to its political reporting and analysis as part of my studies – in particular the paper's take on the Scottish devolution process at the time. Before I had kids I was an avid reader of the travel section, but now that we've decided to settle in the one place for a while – Sydney, Australia – my most read sections are the paper's international political coverage and, more recently, technology and media – essential reading as I work in digital media. I also enjoyed a recent feature on UK expats&nbsp;in the money section. My favourite writers include George Monbiot, Charlie Brooker and Simon Jenkins. Living in Australia, I don't have access to the printed edition, so most of my reading is done via the Guardian website or through Apple's iOS apps. I am more than aware that the Guardian is recognised as one of the boldest, most innovative and forward-looking digital publications in&nbsp;the world. Comment is free and the&nbsp;science and data sections, for example, offer something that no comparable publication anywhere in&nbsp;the world provides.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/theguardian">The Guardian</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media">Digital media</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/australia">Australia</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It is an amateur theatre with a small professional staff, which presents 12 plays each year. In programming our current season, January to December 2012, we set out to ensure women were well-represented in all aspects. Accordingly, we chose six plays by female authors, used five female directors out of the 12 and more than 50% of the roles were for women. Next year, we shall again be offering more roles for women than for men, beginning with Playhouse Creatures by April de Angelis, which is being directed by a woman and will have an all-female crew. Our policy is, in part, driven by the fact that we have more women than men in our acting company, a factor that Stella Duffy highlights in her article (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/12/women-theatre-stand-up-inequality" title="">Theatre of the absurd</a>, 13 December). It makes sense to us to use the talent we have to present the best possible quality of theatre. It seems that a small, provincial theatre, which receives no grant funding, can show the big, subsidised London venues a thing or two.<br /><strong>Susan Seddon</strong><br /><em>Maddermarket Theatre, Norwich</em></p><p></p><p>• Our sexist world, in which women are woefully under-represented on stage, screen and in public life, does not only apply to adults. Over the past few years, while looking after my pre-school granddaughter, I have watched hours of CBeebies with growing fury at the equally woeful under-representation of females in the programmes. Even most of the cartoon characters have male voices. I thought I was imagining it at first, so I did a quick survey using the A-Z programme list, which confirmed my suspicions. TThe presenters were mainly male, too, when I last looked. How depressing that so little progress has been made towards equality since my own children were small. Still, it's as well to get them used to it from an early age, to save them disappointment later.<br /><strong>Sandy Walton</strong><br /><em>London</em></p><p>• I wish to add to Stella Duffy's inspiring list of "actions to be taken" to remedy the inequality imposed on women practitioners in theatre. Fortunately more A-level students are gradually getting the opportunity to study a female playwright but rarely a female director. The obvious example would be Joan Littlewood, one of the most innovative British directors since the war, but also viewed as the mother of the whole theatre In education movement and as the professional director whose liberating rehearsal techniques have most influenced the teaching of drama in schools.&nbsp;Her work was culturally, socially and educationally significant.</p><p>Perhaps the many school/college productions of her Oh! What a Lovely War likely to be staged to mark 1914, the centenary year of the start of the first world war, will help sweep her into the role model status she deserves to have, especially for female drama students, who considerably outnumber the men. That is, of course, if the arts have not by then been completely banished from school curriculums by Michael Gove.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Philip Hedley</strong><br /><em>Director emeritus, Theatre Royal, Stratford East</em>, <em>London</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women">Women</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/film-industry">Film industry</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/equality">Equality</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television">Television industry</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

You're playing, you don't want to stop, so you shovel down your food as fast as you can. When I finally get my children to sit at the table, I&nbsp;spend the whole time shouting at them to "Sit up straight!" It's a battle.</p><p>A doctor would tell you there are good health reasons for sitting up straight when you eat. It gives your intestines the best chance of digesting the food, because you're using your tummy muscles to support you, which helps to push the food down.

Former development secretary Clare Short debates the issue with economist Ha-Joon Chang</p><p>At a time when almost all budgets are facing cuts, the Chancellor has ring-fenced 0.7% of GDP for foreign aid. Was he right to do so? Economist Ha-Joon Chang and the UK's former international development secretary Clare Short discuss. Aida Edemariam listens in.</p><p></p><p><strong>Clare Short:</strong> The UK spends about £8bn on aid. We spend more than £40bn on defence and £600bn on public expenditure, so £8bn is a tiny part. You've got to have funds for famines and crises – and beyond that, Britain massively exploited its colonies in Africa and elsewhere. Funding that helps countries speed up their development is just about decency, and also about the world being safer and more secure in the future.</p><p><strong>Ha-Joon Chang:</strong> In all the recent debates on aid, there is an implicit assumption that aid more or less doesn't work. However, there are many examples of aid working. My own native country, South Korea, is a great example. In the 1960s, it was one of the poorest countries in the world; now it is a donor. In certain periods, foreign aid played a critical role in allowing us to build infrastructure, resolve housing crises, build particular fertiliser factories and so on – if you use it well, aid can be a very good thing. So let's talk about how to make it better rather than talking about getting rid of it. One thing that has really worried me is this decision to get rid of aid to India, which still a very poor country.</p><p><strong>CS:</strong> Forty-two per cent of Indian children are stunted. That means 42% of&nbsp;little bodies and little brains are not getting enough nutrition and clean water to grow – and we say: "Oh, India's rich, we'll walk away."</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> India is the country with the largest number of poor people in the world. Simply because India's average annual income per head has grown from $900 to $1,100 per year, you cannot completely wash your hands of the country, especially given Britain's colonial history.</p><p><strong>Aida Edemariam:</strong> One figure I've seen is&nbsp;that Africa in the past 50 years has received $1tn of aid. Most African countries just don't compare to South Korea in terms of progress.</p><p><strong>CS:</strong> Africa has just had its best decade since independence. The millennium development goal about halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has been met; there's been a massive increase in children in primary education, which is&nbsp;a long-term investment and lifts a&nbsp;country as those children grow up. It's&nbsp;not perfect, there are things that can be done better, yet there is massive, measurable achievement and progress.</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> Aid can be misused, and it has been, both by receiving countries and donor countries. Donors typically add conditions that mean the money comes back to their own country rather than ending up in the recipient country. The World Bank, when giving aid, insists that countries need to abolish all subsidies. Abolishing fertiliser subsidies in some countries in Africa has been a disaster. We need to fix that, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p><strong>AE:</strong> In some countries, a big percentage of the government's budget is from aid.</p><p><strong>CS:</strong> If you put money through government budgets – with supervision, because then you get a say in making sure the money's well spent – you speed up the number of children who can go to school, who are immunised and so on.</p><p><strong>AE:</strong> Supervision can be problematic. Many countries are grateful for Chinese investment, for instance, because it doesn't come with a lecture attached.</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> As someone from a developing country, I have a problem with rich countries thinking they can tell us anything, simply because they are giving money. I'm not opposed to some minimum conditions, especially if they are set in consultation with the recipient country. The problem begins because conditions are intrusive. Imagine if I go to a bank and try to borrow money as a&nbsp;small businessman, and the bank manager says: "Well Mr Chang, you are spending too much time with your family. You need to work 14 hours a day to pay off your debt and see your family for one hour a day." I'd hit the guy and leave the room. There are lines you shouldn't cross, and frankly, some countries have crossed them.</p><p><strong>CS:</strong> There's no doubt that it works best when both sides have an agreement about what wants to be achieved. And there has been a shift in this, to partnership and agreed objectives, and to some external scrutiny of both sides.</p><p><strong>AE:</strong> Conditions are often about transparency – and yet, as this paper reported this week, UK aid money is being funnelled into public-private investment funds and offshore tax havens in places such as Mauritius.</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> The two issues need to be separated. Why do tax havens exist? Because rich countries allow them to. If the US came down on tax havens in the same way they come down on countries that trade with Iran and Cuba, we'd have no tax havens in the world. I'm not, in principle, against private involvement in the aid business – in fact, if aid money can be&nbsp;a seed or a catalyst to bring in more money, why not? The danger is that if you don't monitor it properly, the private sector can actually destroy the nature of&nbsp;the original programme.</p><p><strong>CS:</strong> These instruments were set up during my time in government. They are designed to encourage a country's own savings to get invested in infrastructure. They are heavily structured and supervised, and they have been very successful. But when we set them up, along came advice from the City that, for tax reasons, we need to put them out of Britain. They suggested Mauritius or Dublin, and I said, this is a major UK development instrument – how can it be in another country? And I had to get a special exemption from the Treasury. It took me a couple of years to negotiate it, and that is ludicrous. The right thing is to change the law on tax havens.</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> Could we not introduce a kind of tax exemption for aid-related money? Why do we need to ship it out of the country?</p><p><strong>AE:</strong> It seems as though every Christmas now we're enjoined to buy a goat for someone in Africa. Is that kind of aid&nbsp;useful?</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> Well, you need to do so many things to pull these countries out of poverty. Giving individuals a goat is a good thing, but it's not enough, so I don't want that&nbsp;kind of aid to be considered a replacement for building infrastructure, installing sanitation systems and so on.</p><p><strong>CS:</strong> I don't think food banks are the answer to poverty in Britain. But in the meantime, I think it's a good thing that people are giving aid. Giving a goat is a bit of human generosity, and what's wrong with that?</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> Unfortunately, with the austerity drive, Britain is becoming a bit of a&nbsp;Scrooge. This country used to be very&nbsp;decent, and now it's become narrow-minded and stingy.</p><p><em>Clare Short takes part in the Intelligence Squared and Google+ </em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/versusdebates" title=""><em>Versus debate</em></a><em> "Don't give a goat for Christmas.

But the fact that another mass shooting has occurred is not shocking, any more than the last one was, or the next one will be.</p><p>Just as with the mass killings earlier this year at a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/wisconsin-shooting">Sikh temple in Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/aurora-shooting">Aurora movie theater, near Denver, Colorado</a>, the chorus of empathetic responses that will follow these tragic shootings in Newtown, Connecticut marks a stubborn refrain in a perennial American elegy. Different singers mouthing different words, but basically singing the same song.</p><p>Psychological profiles of the shooter emerge, along with portraits of the victims, while the political class closes ranks so that the nation can heal. Incanted tones to sooth a permanent scar.</p><p>All rituals serve a purpose. And this one is no different.</p><p>This Friday, 28 people are currently reported shot dead, including 20 children. Their families must be given space to mourn, and that space should be respected. </p><p>But it does not honour the dead to insist that there must be no room in that space for rational thought and critical appraisal. Indeed, such situations demand both. For one can only <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/09/giffords-shooting-political-violence-polarised">account for so many "isolated"</a> incidents before it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/21/usgunviolence.usa1">becomes necessary to start dealing</a> with <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/shots-dark">a pattern</a>.</p><p>It is simply not plausible to understand events in Connecticut this Friday without having a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/16/americas-deadly-devotion-guns">conversation about guns</a> in a country where more than 84 people a day are killed with guns, and more than twice that number are injured with them.</p><p>Amid all the column inches and airtime now being devoted to these horrific slayings, though, that elephant in the room will remain affectionately patted, discreetly fed and politely indulged. To <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/20/colorado-theater-shooting-gun-control-debate">claim that "this is not the time"</a> ignores the reality that America has found itself incapable of finding any appropriate time to have this urgent conversation. The victims in Newtown, Connecticut deserve at least that. And these tragedies take place everyday, albeit on a smaller scale.</p><p>America's president, Barack Obama, understands this. The <a href="http://uptownmagazine.com/2012/06/chicago-homicide-rate-worse-than-kabul-la-and-nyc/">number of homicide victims</a> in his home town of Chicago this year has outnumbered the fatalities among US troops serving in Kabul.</p><p>In response to the Aurora shootings in July, President Obama was right to suspend the routine campaign rhetoric and play the statesman. Nobody wanted to hear about Mitt Romney's tax records and stimulating the economy on that day. There were other days for electioneering, true, but he was wrong to insist on this:</p><blockquote><p>"There are going to be other days for politics. This is a day for prayer and reflection."</p></blockquote><p>Yet that "other day" for debating gun laws never came – not at any point in the three months that remained before the election. Even now, right on cue, the president's spokesman, Jay Carney, has intoned the familiar strain that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/dec/14/newtown-connecticut-school-shooting-live#block-50cb71fc95cba457d7011b83">"now is not the time" to talk about gun control</a>.</p><p>For what are we to reflect on if not how this, and so many other similar calamities, came about. Those who insist that we should not "play politics" with the victim's grief conveniently ignore that politics is what caused that grief. Not party politics. But a blend of opportunism on the right that flagrantly mischaracterises the issue, and spinelessness on the left that refuses to address it.</p><p>Americans are no more prone to mental illness or violence than any other people in the world. What they do have is more guns: roughly, 90 for every 100 people. And regions and states with higher rates of gun ownership have significantly higher rates of homicide than states with lower rates of gun ownership.</p><p>The trite insistence that "guns don't kill people, people kill people" simply avoids the reality that people can kill people much more easily with guns than anything else that's accessible. Americans understand this. That's why a <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/guns.htm">plurality supports greater gun control</a>, and a majority thinks the sale of firearms should be more tightly regulated.</p><p>The trouble is that people feel powerless to do anything about it. The gun lobby has proved sufficiently potent in rallying opposition to virtually all gun control measures that Democrats have all but given up on arguing for it. In the meantime, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/09/usa.usgunviolence">country is literally and metaphorically dying</a> for it.</p><p>Gun control <em>is</em> possible. There are both a constituency for it and an argument for it. But it can't happen without a political coalition prepared to fight for it.</p><p>If America can twice elect a black president, it can do this.</p><p>• Editor's note: this is a revised and updated version of an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/20/america-needs-talk-gun-control-wake-colorado">article by Gary Younge that appeared 20 July 2012</a>.

The government is taking action to crack down on these practices</p><p>Tax avoidance, sham directors, money laundering: the recent <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/nov/25/offshore-secrets-revealed-shadowy-side" title="">Guardian investigation</a> made sobering reading. In the UK we are proud that it is easier and cheaper to set up a company here than just about anywhere in the world. This flexibility is hugely valued by the start-ups and small companies which create a significant proportion of our wealth and jobs, and which are vital to recovery from the latest recession. But this flexibility provides a challenge: how do we stop our system from being abused by people who want to use it to dodge tax or to launder the proceeds of crime?</p><p>This is not a new problem. From the <a href="http://www.thisisguernsey.com/news/2012/11/27/offer-to-hide-6m-shown-by-panorama/" title="">Sark-larkers</a> of the 1980s, who briefly made a small island in the English Channel into an (apparent) global centre of company formation, to the issues highlighted by the Guardian, the UK has always been confronted with individuals seeking to play the system. British company law and corporate governance is, in general, globally respected, and the vast majority abide by the rules. That is why we must identify and stop the minority who sail too close to the wind in order to protect the UK's reputation as a trusted place to do business.</p><p>Becoming a company director carries with it <a href="https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/directors-responsibilities" title="">legal responsibilities</a> which, if breached, can result in disqualification, fines and prison. Some people think that putting up a straw man as a director makes them immune from the consequences. This is not the case: if you are acting as a director, you are liable.</p><p>The government takes breaches of the law seriously. Last year we disqualified more than 1,100 directors, including people who were not formally registered or appointed as directors and shadow directors. We also wound up 355 companies in the public interest and pursued many others for tax evasion and other offences. We are investigating the allegations against the individuals and companies made by the Guardian and Panorama and, where there is a strong legal case, we will take action. We are also reviewing our legal and enforcement priorities to ensure that we are focusing resources on the most serious abuses. Concerns have been raised about the potential abuse of arrangements for hidden ownership, and I am attracted to the idea of increasing transparency to prevent the concealment of corporate control. Where there is flagrant abuse of corporate entities, we will seek to tackle it.</p><p>Many of the more sophisticated schemes cross international boundaries, looking to use weaknesses in local laws or international co-operation to hide activities and assets from national law enforcement and tax authorities. We must build on the emerging network of intergovernmental co-operation to counter tax evasion and avoidance, and have recently signed an <a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2012/december/uk-and-isle-of-man-sign-fatca-style-tax-information-sharing-agreement/" title="">enhanced tax information exchange agreement with the US</a>. We are looking to do the same with other jurisdictions.</p><p>We need to drive forward global improvements to transparency to tackle corruption and drive prosperity and growth for all, and we are determined to lead international action in this area. In the developed world, we should put our own house in order – and thereby help developing countries to prosper too.</p><p>The UK has also been working to ensure that the EU sets a new global standard for transparency in the extractives industry. Tough new rules on reporting are designed to ensure that citizens of developing countries can hold their governments to account over how payments from oil, mining and gas companies are spent. This will help ensure that the sale of natural resources benefits the many, not the few.</p><p>The message we need to send is simple: there should be no hiding place for the proceeds of crime, corruption and tax dodging.</p><p><em>Vince Cable is secretary of state for business, innovation and skills</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/taxavoidance">Tax avoidance</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/corporate-governance">Corporate governance</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vincentcable">Vince Cable</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In parliament, they're quite used to talking about gay people. In 1921, for instance, the House of Lords debated amending the sexual offences bill to include not only men but also "any act of gross indecency between female persons". <a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1921/aug/15/commons-amendment-2" title="">First to speak</a> was the Earl of Malmesbury, who apologised for raising "a discussion upon what must be, to all of us, a most disgusting and polluting subject". Eventually the Lord Bishop of Norwich withdrew his amendment, persuaded that such "vice" barely existed and that a criminal ban risked "advertising" and therefore increasing such horrors. Throughout the proceedings, the word "lesbian" was not spoken once.</p><p>We probably find that more amusing than appalling these days, gazing upon the dinosaur customs of the Downton era (even if, a century later, hereditary peers and bishops still have permanent seats in the Lords). But such attitudes are not ancient history: restrictions on gay people, if not phrased quite the same way, remained in place long into our own time. Consider that until 2003 no law prevented an employer sacking, or refusing to hire, someone on the grounds that he or she was gay. Or that as late as 2007, a landlord could evict or refuse to take on a tenant for the same reason. Or that gay men and women could not serve openly in the military until little more than a decade ago, just as the age of consent varied depending on whether you were attracted to people of the same or opposite sex. Yet here we are now, a few short years later, poised to take what gay rights activists regard as the last step towards full legal equality: access to marriage for everyone, regardless of whom they love.</p><p>Because we look back so rarely, we can miss how truly radical and rapid this change has been. Less than 25 years ago, a Conservative government could pass a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/02/david-cameron-gay-pride-apology" title="">section 28</a> that made "promoting homosexuality" illegal and banned any state school teaching "the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship". Pause on that word – pretended – and consider that gay couples can now adopt children and that it is a Tory-led government that's legislating for same-sex marriage. On this issue, the landscape has been utterly transformed in a single generation.</p><p>What explains such a quick and complete shift? Who can claim credit for what is perhaps the fastest, most thorough and relatively painless social revolution in our history?</p><p>The politicians would want us to start with them – and only a churl would deny the last Labour government credit for the raft of reforms it passed, culminating in the creation of civil partnerships which, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/dec/11/2011-census-data-key-points" title="">we learned this week</a>, have now been taken up by 105,000 people. While Tony Blair hedged and trimmed on so much, the necessity of compromise leaving this or that group feeling let down, it's striking that on gay rights, Labour delivered completely.</p><p>On the right, something similar is at work today. David Cameron has abandoned so many of his early modernising promises – the huskies and hoodies discarded long ago – yet on gay equality he has stood firm. George Osborne is happy to play pantomime Scrooge, snarling at the workless poor, yet he remains open and inclusive on sexuality. Ditto his allies in the commentariat: rightwing on everything else, right-on on gay matters. It seems gay equality is the one modernising article of faith that can never be recanted. "It's become a lodestar for 'are you comfortable in the 21st century?'," says Stonewall's Ben Summerskill – for a politician to be hostile to gay equality is like admitting he doesn't know how to use a computer. Which makes it all the more troubling for Cameron that he will have to rely on Labour votes to get equal marriage through the Commons.</p><p>But the near unity of today's political class on gay rights cannot fully explain the transformation: it's as much consequence as cause. Credit must also go to a change in popular culture. Even 40 years ago, gay men (though not lesbians) were visible in the British entertainment mainstream: think Danny La Rue or John Inman. But they were caricatures, never seen with partners, never to be imagined in real relationships. Over the&nbsp;last two or more decades – punctuated by a series of landmarks, whether the gay kiss on EastEnders, the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/when-anna-and-beth-kissed-margaret-anna-friel-plays-brooksides-lesbian-pinup-monique-roffey-met-her-1440368.html" title="">lesbian kiss on Brookside</a> or George Michael or Stephen Gately coming out – that has changed, steadily making what was once deemed abnormal, normal. In the US, attitudes to gay marriage are changing at dizzying speed – just as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442437/" title="">Modern Family</a>, with a gay couple at&nbsp;its&nbsp;heart, has become one of America's most-watched sitcoms. Bit by bit, what used to be "other" has become unthreateningly familiar.</p><p>The process has worked exponentially, change begetting change. The more gay people come out, the more straight people know gay people in their daily lives, the more ordinary it becomes, the more gay people come out. On it goes, in a virtuous circle. Summerskill cites civil partnerships as a prime example, dispelling some of the old stereotypes about promiscuity and sending a message to both straights and gays: "Once you've seen one of those&nbsp;ceremonies on your street you can&nbsp;be in denial no longer."</p><p></p><p>Were politicians responsible for this shift or responding to it? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Herbert#Personal_life" title="">Nick Herbert</a>, the first openly gay man to be selected as a Tory parliamentary candidate, is surely right to believe the answer is both: "It sometimes happens that society is on the cusp of change when parliament steps in and helps the tide to break."</p><p>But none of it would have happened without hard work. The gay rights campaign has been a story of phenomenal success, combining attention-grabbing direct action with quiet, behind-the-scenes lobbying – <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2000/feb/27/letters.letters7" title="">suffragettes and suffragists, as Peter Tatchell</a> puts it, with himself firmly in the former camp. His <a href="http://outrage.org.uk/" title="">OutRage!</a> group regularly exposed the absurdity of discrimination: in 1992, he organised five same-sex couples to file for marriage licences at a London register office. Rejected 20 years ago, those couples will soon get their wish.</p><p>There are lessons here for other campaigning minorities. But not just them. This remarkable struggle has, says&nbsp;Tatchell, "helped everyone, gay and straight. It's made Britain a kinder, more liberal society." I think he's right. When this last piece of legislation is passed, we should all raise a glass – celebrating a movement that has made our country a better, happier place to live.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href="https://twitter.com/j_freedland" title=""><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gay-marriage">Gay marriage</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights">Gay rights</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/marriage">Marriage</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality">Sexuality</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonathanfreedland">Jonathan Freedland</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He was sacked by Mrs T after less than two years and later transmogrified into Lord St John of Fawsley, though not before many unforgettable appearances in parliament. Ferdinand Mount in the Spectator once described Norman at the despatch box as a cross between Pope Pius XII and Larry Grayson.</p><p>But his mark endures. His chief legacy was the much enlarged system of parliamentary select committees, such as the home affairs committee, which has just issued a report on drugs; the public accounts committee, whose assault on Starbucks forced the company to cough up taxes; or the quaintly named culture, media and sport select committee, before which Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/dec/11/leveson-inquiry-lord-hunt-press-regulation" title="">appeared on Tuesday</a>.</p><p>A case can be made – was indeed made with much self-congratulation on Week in Westminster on Radio 4 last Saturday by Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee – that these committees have greatly enhanced the role of parliament.</p><p>And yet at the time, more than 30 years ago, a contrary case was made: that the new committees would encourage grandstanding by MPs and, still worse, that they would be bound to detract from the importance – and weaken the power of – the House of Commons itself. Might not that warning have come true?</p><p>These committees certainly keep busy. On Wednesday the science and technology, work and pensions, public administration, Treasury, public accounts, environment, food and rural affairs, and communities and local government committees all heard evidence in rooms with names redolent of <a href="http://www.civitas.org.uk/islandstory/" title="">Our Island Story</a> – the Wilson room, the Grimond room and the Thatcher room. Some of the work they do is doubtless useful, even if the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/dec/10/david-cameron-rejects-royal-commission-drugs" title="">latest recommendation on drugs</a> is a statement of the bleeding obvious, which some of us have been muttering unheard for decades past.</p><p>Most of those hearings pass without any public notice, but then the ones we all remember are dubious. Years ago the US <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/oct/21/archive-communist-infiltration-in-hollywood-1947" title="">House of Representatives committee on un-American activities </a>became nationally and internationally notorious for bullying and humiliating witnesses, and the English, even Tories, were disdainful of that coarse American brutality. But our own committees have taken it as a model.</p><p>Can anyone forget the sight of Dr David Kelly, the weapons inspector, <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmfaff/1025/3071510.htm" title="">being berated by MPs</a>, with Andrew MacKinlay telling him "you are chaff"? MacKinlay was actually one of the better Labour MPs of the time, and was remorseful when Kelly shortly afterwards killed himself. No doubt we all enjoyed watching <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15673551" title="">James Murdoch squirm (as far as he is capable of doing) while being told he was a mafia boss</a> by the Labour MP Tom Watson. Or again, there was that odd-looking bloke with big hair whose security firm fouled up at the Olympics, and who was ritually shamed by a committee chaired by Keith Vaz, with David Winnick, one more Labour MP, telling him it was "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/video/2012/jul/17/g4s-boss-humiliating-shambles-video" title="">a humiliating shambles</a>".</p><p>But hold on. MPs like to say they work arduously and do a good job. Now the real – the central, the all-important – job of parliament should be scrutinising legislation and holding the executive to account. In those respects, the record of the Commons in recent years has been pitiful. The last Labour government was a conveyor belt for laws, some tabloid-driven, most badly drafted. An egregious example was the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 – to protect children and vulnerable adults – which went through parliament unexamined but <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/sep/11/criminal-checks-parents-scouts" title="">whose consequences</a> have been as lamentable as was widely foreseen.</p><p>So were the consequences of the worst crime and folly in our recent history, an unneeded, unwanted, unlawful and horrible war whose 10th anniversary we are approaching. When I hear MPs singing their own praises, or watch them bullying witnesses, I consult yet again the division list for the&nbsp;crucial <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/documents/upload/snsg-02109.pdf" title="">Commons votes of 26 February and 18 March 2003</a>: the two government motions favouring an invasion and the contrary amendments saying – what almost no one would now dispute – that "the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established".</p><p>So what do Margaret Hodge, Andrew MacKinlay, Tom Watson, Keith Vaz and David Winnick have in common apart from their committee work? Yes, that's right. They all voted for the Iraq war. That was rather more of a humiliating shambles than any security failure at the&nbsp;Olympics, one might think, and a very disgraceful moment in parliamentary history. Useful as the committees may sometimes be, it's time for MPs to&nbsp;pull themselves together and knuckle&nbsp;down to their proper work, in the chamber of the house.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/houseofcommons">House of Commons</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/geoffreywheatcroft">Geoffrey Wheatcroft</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Back in the 70s, the big idea was that salvation was unavoidably political. Just as Moses led his people out of slavery, so it was the task of the church to help lead people out of poverty. Inspired by the work of Latin American base communities in the Roman Catholic church, theology became a tool to give the poorest a rallying point for resistance to political oppression, not least in the area of land reform.</p><p>But in the early 90s the Vatican became increasingly nervous of priests behaving as revolutionaries. They shut down the base communities and appointed a succession of conservative bishops in places like Brazil to stamp out the creeping influence of Marxism – an ideology that was loathed by the Polish pope John Paul II. From here on in, liberation theology was something that would only exist in the textbooks of trendy European intellectuals. That, at least, is the popular wisdom. But it's not the full picture. Liberation theology in South America may no longer be influential in the mainstream churches, but it remains a potent force among the poor themselves.</p><p>Driving north out of Brasilia, one appreciates the problems Brazil continues to have with land distribution. For over an hour one passes through the same vast farm. It is mile after mile of fenced off monoculture, with the land being worked by huge machines that look like Transformers. This is partly how Brazil got to be the fifth largest economy in the world. But nestled between the fields of powerful agribusiness farms one finds a completely different Brazil.</p><p>The red flag of the The Landless Workers Movement (MST) welcomed us to the settlement. MST is the largest social movement in Latin America with over a million members. Like the 17th-century Diggers, they are squatters with attitude. Priced off the land and receiving no benefit from Brazil's supposed economic miracle, they find what land they can and occupy it, living communally and growing their own crops.</p><p>I cooked over a wood fire for 35 families. They said my farofa wasn't bad for a gringo. Fried onions and garlic, pork scratchings and cassava flour. We discussed the disgusting pesticides that the farm's aeroplanes spray over the settlement as a way of getting them to move on. The MST insists that the death of a two-year-old boy from the camp was a direct result of exposure to these chemicals. And the institutional churches do little to help. Yet a rough painting of Christ stood guard at the entrance of the next MST settlement we visited. And a quote from Matthew's gospel: "I will be with you to the end of time." As we left, one of the workers made an impromptu speech quoting Brecht on dialectics and raised her fist in a defiant leftist salute. Here, Jesus and Marx walk hand in hand.</p><p>Liberation theology inspired the founding of the MST back in 1984, during the fall of the dictatorship. Indeed, even before liberation theology found its name, it was the influence of the Catholic church's teaching that land distribution must have a social function which spooked the powerful Brazilian landowners who backed the military coup against communism in 1964. But with some heroic exceptions, the mainstream churches have given up the struggle of the social gospel in favour of a feel-good theology that brings in the punters. But even without institutional support, liberation theology remains alive and well in the settlements of the countryside and city favelas. What they need to do now is remind the churches of their own teaching: "I come to bring good news to the poor and freedom to the captive."</p><p><strong>Twitter: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/giles_fraser" title=""><strong>@giles_fraser</strong></a></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/brazil">Brazil</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/anglicanism">Anglicanism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christianity">Christianity</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion">Religion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london">London</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas">Americas</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/gilesfraser">Giles Fraser</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Christmas is the one time they can be depended on to return</p><p>At railway stations all across Britain next week, groups of students will gather with their backpacks to await the trains that will carry them home for Christmas. There they will be, shivering on the windy platforms of Leuchars-for-St-Andrews, standing forlornly below the train indicator at Euston, holding paper napkins filled with dripping pizzas in Leeds. This is as large a movement of human beings as preceded an averagely big push on the Western Front, but with&nbsp;more contradictory traffic flows, so&nbsp;that trains filled with the young pass each other travelling in every direction.</p><p>A more parsimonious and perhaps more sensible social economy would arrange things differently. It would send students to the college or university closest to their parents' homes. There would be unhappy consequences: in university towns, pubs, clubs, minicabs, takeaways and buy-to-let landlords would see a drop in income, while coaches and trains would run far emptier. Worse, for the individual student, would be the loss of that transition known as a rite of passage, which for previous male generations was marked more cheaply by National Service or being measured for one's first Burton's suit. An argument can be heard in many households: "We live in X. The university of X has a fine reputation. Why not attend X's university rather than Y's, which is 300 miles away, and save on travel, rent and food?" But in my experience it finds little traction. To the&nbsp;would-be student, leaving home is a&nbsp;more essential part of "the student experience" than the qualification that&nbsp;lies at the end of it. To satisfy this yearning, the state provides grants and loans and parents shell out their savings – a vast transfer of wealth that keeps many city economies alive and leaves behind empty bedrooms.</p><p>I have been looking at ours: the empty nest. In our daughter's bedroom, last permanently occupied two years ago, the posters have come down but the corkboard is still there, with its mementoes: theatre tickets, an Abercrombie & Fitch label, a photo of the cast of Spooks. Shelves hold miniaturised animals and books by Zoë Heller, Ian McEwan, Jane Austen. Her bed is made, as is our son's upstairs, though because he's been gone only a month or two, his room is more complete, like Captain Scott's hut or the chamber at the centre of a pyramid, minus the sarcophagus. It contains more books by Bill Bryson than Bill Bryson knows he&nbsp;has written. The walls have maps, pictures of ships and a poster of the Beatles. Football scarves lie folded over a chair arm: Juventus, Queen's Park&nbsp;FC, Leyton Orient. The last team is&nbsp;the only one we've been to see play – charmingly, a man behind us had an old-fashioned rattle. A visit to Turin explains Juventus, while a trip to Glasgow to watch <a href="http://www.queensparkfc.co.uk/" title="">Queen's Park</a>, the last&nbsp;of Britain's great amateur sides, remains an unfulfilled ambition. (In our&nbsp;conversations, did I invent the fact that the club song is sung in Latin?)</p><p>All this is evidence of how things were. A tempting comparison is with the widow who can't bear to empty her dead husband's wardrobe and throw away his suits; but that won't quite do, because the absent tenants of these rooms are very much alive and would furiously protest the journey Oxfam-wards of the tiniest miniature animal, never mind a suit. So the rooms stay as they are for a different reason – because their former occupants occasionally return, and may one day, the country's economy being as it is, settle in again more permanently. If these rooms could speak to the people who once slept in them, they'd say: "We'll always be here for you." To us, their silence – the greater quiet of the whole house – tells a different and less bearable story. A long, lively passage in our lives is over. After our daughter left, my wife would sometimes go to her room – pictures of Spooks, etc – and cry.</p><p>I wonder now about the callousness of my own home leave-taking. Did I&nbsp;understand that, as the last of their children to move out, my parents would miss me? Not for a second. I was 18 when my mother came with me to Glasgow to make sure I had somewhere "decent" to stay. Glasgow was only 40 miles from our village, but seemed much further, it being on the other side of the country ("through in the west", as&nbsp;we described it) and visited perhaps&nbsp;once a year. She had a list of recommended lodgings, and we traipsed around the shabby streets near St George's Cross inspecting rooms to let until we found a street and a landlady who looked less careworn than&nbsp;the rest, and agreed to a price of 35&nbsp;shillings a week. After I moved in, Glasgow absorbed me more and more. It&nbsp;seemed infinite: it offered new friendships and a&nbsp;rich <em>terra incognita</em> of&nbsp;streets, cinemas and dance halls that demanded exploration and custom.</p><p>At first, I went home every weekend with my washing, but then those visits became less regular. How did I let my parents know I was coming? They had no phone. Perhaps I wrote to them ("Expect me with dirty shirts this Friday pm"), but more likely I didn't let them know, and just turned up or didn't turn up, not understanding that my parents' dashed hopes of seeing me were a greater casualty of my carelessness than a spoiled tea. At Christmas I went to department stores in Buchanan Street and bought inexpensive ornaments and prints, again not understanding – or not&nbsp;understanding well enough – that seeing more of me was worth any number of smoked glass decanters or&nbsp;pictures by the Impressionists (an unusually dreary example of which replaced <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millet-between-two-fires-n01611/text-catalogue-entry" title="">FD Millet's Between Two Fires</a> in the frame above the fireplace, until my parents, suffering it in silence for long enough, papered it over with Constable's The Hay Wain).</p><p>And in all this I suspect I was typical, at least of young men. As for our fathers and mothers, none of them talked of "empty-nest syndrome", even though its implication that the principal human duty is to protect and feed the young would have suited their generation better than ours. Then, the feelings of loss went without a name. Today, it's a condition with remedies. <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/about/" title="">The Mayo Clinic</a>, for example, suggests you try to&nbsp;maintain regular contact with your children through "visits, phone calls, emails, texts or video chats". If you feel&nbsp;depressed, lean on loved ones or your mental health provider. Above all, stay positive: "Thinking about the extra time and energy you might have to devote to your marriage or personal interests after your last child leaves home might help you adapt to this major life change."</p><p>All useful advice, if banal. What can't&nbsp;be denied or wished away, however, is that children leave home. In&nbsp;modern societies, this is what they do&nbsp;(in pre-modern ones, unless they joined the army or went to sea, they might stick around the ancestral field for&nbsp;ever). Christmas is the one time they&nbsp;can be depended on to return. For the non-religious, that fact may be this season's true balm and significance.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting">Parents and parenting</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family">Family</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education">Higher education</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ianjack">Ian Jack</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

VAT has already risen, tax credits are being shredded and the party's costly fixation with higher personal allowances will not adequately compensate the poor. It is increasingly hard to discern any progressive element to this government on the fiscal front.</p><p>On social affairs, by contrast, the coalition's Lib Dem wing is more inclined to flap, as the last seven days have demonstrated, in marked and perhaps deliberate contrast to the week before. Pushing on with gay marriage represented a liberal victory over some, though not all, Conservatives. Mr Clegg has also <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/dec/14/nick-clegg-reform-drugs-laws" title="">spoken brave sense on drugs</a>, although his hopes of calling time on a lost war will no more disturb reality than a dream from the opium den. More significantly, he told Theresa May to go "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/11/snooper-bill-clegg-may" title="">back to the drawing board</a>" on electronic surveillance.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/draft-communications-bill/" title="">draft communications bill</a> is sold as an incremental update of surveillance techniques, but in a world where loves, interests and anxieties are all routinely explored online, to entitle the state to keep automated tabs on the pattern of our communications and internet use is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/02/monitoring-communications-shrivelling-domain-privacy" title="">to invite a silent spy</a> into every home. It is exactly the sort of thing that the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/17/surveillance-civil-liberties" title="">late great Lord Bingham</a> had in mind when he warned that Britons were becoming "the most spied-upon people in the democratic world". Two parliamentary committees, including the prime ministerially appointed <a href="http://isc.independent.gov.uk/" title="">intelligence and security committee</a>, have registered concerns of practicality and principle. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/dec/11/leading-tories-snoopers-charter-clegg-rewrite" title="">Freedom-loving Tories</a> have spoken up against, and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2246156/Nick-Clegg-orders-Home-Office-drawing-board-Communications-Bill-plan-monitor-phone-records-internet-use.html" title="">the Daily Mail</a> has rallied to the ideal that an Englishman's cache is his castle. Mr Clegg is standing important ground here, but it is hardly difficult ground to defend.</p><p>The real test of Lib Dem mettle will instead come over secret courts. The party in the country <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/25/liberal-democrat-secret-justice-proposals-editorial" title="">spoke loud and clear</a> at its conference in September, defeating the platform's call for compromise, and resolving that justice in the dark is no justice at all. If that sounds like airy rhetoric, call to mind the gritty detail of cases <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/libyan-dissident-gets-22m-payout-from-government-over-rendition-to-libya-8412919.html" title="">such as Sami al-Saadi</a>, the Libyan dissident paid £2.2m by Britain this week. His claim is that MI6 played an important part in his rendition to Tripoli, where he was locked up and tortured by the Gaddafi regime, and the size of the settlement does not suggest that this can be lightly dismissed. This is precisely the sort of case that secret courts would keep hidden. Indeed, the proposals were cooked up after Whitehall had raged at previous payouts relating to allegations of British complicity in rendition, and it could even be that Mr al-Saadi – who provocatively points to his unhappy experience of secret justice in Libya – decided to settle because he foresaw that the legislation would pass in time to deny him his day in court.</p><p>Expect to hear a good deal about changes round the edges, which were made to the bill in the Lords. David Cameron confirmed <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/dec/11/david-cameron-secret-courts-policy" title="">this week</a> that the decision as to when to switch off the light in court will now rest with a judge, whereas in the breathtaking original plans the decision was effectively the minister's. Welcome as that change is, it offers little protection – judges traditionally defer to the executive when the security whistle is blown. Other amendments, such as a supposedly equivalent right for individual litigants to demand secrecy (when would they want this?) are an irrelevance. None of the changes touch the heart of the matter – that by allowing one side to rely upon secret evidence which the other cannot challenge, the plan will upset the scales of justice. If the Lib Dems truly want to demonstrate that they are still a countervailing force against Tory authoritarianism, then tipping these scales back to balance would be the place to start.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberaldemocrats">Liberal Democrats</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/open-justice">Open justice</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/justice-and-security">Justice and security bill</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Is it insane to imagine a world where the only cards you opened and read came in envelopes, from real people who knew you and wrote out their news by hand? Well, yes, it clearly is insane. But how much better such a mad world would be. No one wants Christmas cards to be purely Christian. Few people want them even to be mainly Christian. They were always a celebration of the warm domestic pleasures of the midwinter solstice. Like the ox and ass in the stable they celebrate the triumph of animal warmth over a chilly and unwelcoming world outside. But now they just celebrate their senders, Christmas cards have become the purest form of vanity publishing. Whether they depict the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/07/david-cameron-christmas-card" title="">discreet smirks of the Camerons or Milibands</a>, or are instead wrapped round the artless boasting of the less-famous fortunate, they are just advertising. Self-advertisement is bad, but worse is the naked commercial advertisement of the Christmas card from anyone who has managed to sell you anything at any time in the last decade. The card has become just another piece of the junk mail that keeps the post office going. At 60p for a first-class stamp, that will not last. They won't be missed. A world where the only Christmas letters we had were handwritten with care and thought is – sadly – unthinkable today.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/christmas">Christmas</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Five months later he went to watch Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough and never came home.</p><p>After his death his mother found it too painful to play the song, but now, 23 years later, she has renewed reason to listen again. On Monday <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/watch-he-ain-t-heavy-video-now" title="">a star-studded version of the track</a> will be released in time to challenge for Christmas number one, with all proceeds going to the legal costs of a fresh inquest into the tragedy. It is a fitting bookmark to a momentous year, said Aspinall, the chair of the <a href="http://hfsg.co.uk/" title="">Hillsborough Families Support Group</a>. "When we hear that song now, we know it is a tribute to the memories of our loved ones, – and I can't think of anything better than that," she said.</p><p>The Guy Chambers produced song – featuring Liverpool's most feted son Sir Paul McCartney alongside stars including Robbie Williams, Shane MacGowan, Holly Johnson and Gerry Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers – is the bookies' favourite for Christmas number one. Four months ago, an independent report <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-police-coverup-revealed" title="">revealed the failings</a> that led to the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans in a crush at Hillsborough and the full extent of the cover-up that followed. Beverley Knight, Paloma Faith, Rebecca Ferguson and former Spice Girl Mel C are among the singers, while ex-Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, football pundit Alan Hansen and comedian John Bishop make a less tuneful appearance.</p><p>Several musicians have spent decades involved in the Hillsborough families' campaign. <a href="http://www.thefarmmusic.co.uk/" title="">The Farm's</a> <a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/topics/peter-hooton/" title="">Peter Hooton</a>, toured as part of the Justice Collective last year with musicians including Mick Jones of the Clash and Pete Wylie, to raise awareness of the campaign and money for charity. "There is no way we could have envisaged this a year ago – perceptions have changed so much," he said. "We've gone from playing in front of 1,000 people in the Scala as the Justice Tonight Band to challenging for number one – it's been a massive journey."</p><p>He Ain't Heavy by The Justice Collective has all the hallmarks of a Christmas charity single: lush production, soaring accompaniment from the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and celebrity hands clasped over headphones. But behind the glitz there is a serious aim, said Hooton. "Hopefully on Christmas Day people will watch the video, think about Hillsborough and see the names of those who were killed," he said. "We are reaching out to a new generation of people who may not have been born when Hillsborough happened – and now they are asking questions. [The song] is not going to get anyone in court, but if it gets to number one it might just put a bit more pressure on the government and keep the wheels of justice turning."</p><p>For Steve Rotheram, Labour MP for Walton who was instrumental in bringing artists together and enlisting the support of the families, the swell of support for the song reflects a transformation in people's perception of Hillsborough following the report in September. "It felt like finally people were sitting up and taking notice," he said. "It seems like everybody now is listening and the tide has turned."</p><p>An application to quash the original Hillsborough inquest verdicts is due to be heard at the high court next Wednesday. Attorney general Dominic Grieve has said there is a good case for setting aside the accidental death verdicts and holding new hearings into the deaths in the 1989 football stadium disaster. The choice of song, with its lyrics "The road is long/With many a winding turn/That leads us to who knows where/ Who knows when", was inspired, said Chambers, who played a key role getting key artists like Robbie Williams to get involved. "The lyrics so perfectly describe that emotion of one person wanting to reach out and help another, and if we don't help each other then everything is lost," said the songwriter and producer, who spent part of his childhood in Liverpool. "If this record can help in any way, I wanted to be involved."</p><p>The decision to use the Hollies song came after one of the most extraordinary moments of the 2012 football season. Five days after the <a href="http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/" title="">Independent Hillsborough Panel</a> report Everton - Liverpool's rivals from across Stanley Park – paid tribute to those who had died before a match against Newcastle United. Before kickoff two mascots, a girl in Everton blue and a boy in the red of Liverpool, led the players on to the pitch. As they stood holding hands, He Ain't Heavy was played over the tannoy.</p><p>Magaret Aspinall said: "All my hair stood up and I could just remember James handing me the record. I wondered if he was trying to tell me something, and he probably was. He was saying 'Mum, there's going to be another version and you are going to like it'." Aspinall, like many family members, hopes the song gets to number one and keeps their battle justice in the public eye. "Like the song says, it's been a hell of a road, but we are still on it. We've got the truth but that is not the end," she said. "It's still a winding road until we get accountability - that's when this journey will come to an end."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock">Pop and rock</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/hillsborough-disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/christmas">Christmas</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexandratopping">Alexandra Topping</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That, at least, was how Virginia (later Woolf) liked to tell it, seeing the exhilarating dash across town as a symbolic break with the heavy legacy of her family's past. "Everything," she wrote later, "was on trial," by which she meant not just table napkins and wallpaper but art, literature and sleeping arrangements too.</p><p>This was heady stuff, yet Bloomsbury, both as a physical location and a cultural notation, had been getting on perfectly well before the Stephen girls annexed it to their personal mythology. It was as early as the mid-18th century that the area began to build a reputation as the brainiest bit of London. Scholars then liked to refer to their age as heralding the "March of the Mind", and the mind, in this case, decided to march east and take lodgings on the Duke of Bedford's respectable, if not quite fashionable, estate. It was here, in the lee of the new <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/" title="">British Museum</a>, that a slew of colleges, schools, hospitals and dissident churches set out their stall. By the mid-Victorian years, Bloomsbury had become home to exactly that "aristocracy of intellect" – barristers, writers and professors of a progressive tint – from which the Stephen girls derived their cultural confidence, not to mention the money to pay the rent on 46 Gordon Square. By moving to Bloomsbury they were not so much striking out as coming home.</p><p>In her absorbing book, researched from the ground up, <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english/about/staff/ra.htm" title="">Rosemary Ashton</a> maps out a cultural history of Bloomsbury in the 19th century. It was, she claims proudly (she is a professor at University College London and so is allowed to be proud), a place of firsts. The first kindergarten, teacher training college, women's college, all started as pop-ups in WC1 (no one was ever sure how long anything would last).</p><p>This means that to some extent Ashton is obliged to organise her narrative around a series of institutional micro-histories. This could have been dull were it not for the fact that the do-gooders of Bloomsbury turn out to be just like any other set of clever egotists working on a shoestring. That is to say, they spent a huge a proportion of their time shouting, flouncing, bitching, back-stabbing and sleeping with people they really shouldn't.</p><p>There is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Munby" title="">Arthur Munby</a>, for instance, a man usually written about solely in terms of his fetish for working-class women and his secret relationship with the scullery maid Hannah Cullwick. In Ashton's book Munby appears as others would have known him, as a genuine liberal with a strong interest in educational reform. He taught Latin to working men, and campaigned for women to go to university. All the same, Munby could never quite stop his inner life poking through. Giving a talk at the newly formed Working Women's College in 1867, he tried to persuade a room of ambitious shop girls that they might do a lot better by taking to the fields to earn their daily bread. That way, he explained excitedly, they would develop lovely bronzed and brawny arms and maybe even break a sweat. The ladies of WC1 remained markedly unmoved.</p><p>Ashton gives us some excellent villains too, the best of whom is <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/lardner_dionysius.htm" title="">Dionysius Lardner</a>, who only just loses the prize for daftest name in Victorian Bloomsbury to <a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/smirkesydney/index.html" title="">Sydney Smirke</a>, the architect responsible for the circular reading room at the British Museum. The Rev Lardner was appointed shortly after the founding of London University (later University College) in 1826. His formal title was professor of natural philosophy and astronomy, but a more accurate job description might have been professor of steam engines. He loved them, lectured on them, modelled them, and liked nothing better than getting his hands dirty by superintending the building of two of Boulton & Watt's early try-outs.</p><p>Lardner was also, though, a bit of a chancer and not very clerical at all. He oscillated between boasting about his quite modest achievements and making veiled threats regarding his salary. He also lived up to his Christian name by running off with someone else's wife and was found eventually a long way from Bloomsbury, hiding under a piano in a Parisian boarding house.</p><p>Ashton is quick to see the modern parallels at work in her narrative yet subtle enough not to over-play them. Right from the start, she explains, UCL was all about the money. Built as a speculative venture, it was dismissed by the toffs as "the joint stock university". The idea behind it was to provide a cheaper education for the middle classes who could not afford to send their boys to Oxford, where they would be lost to drink, cards and expensive tailoring.</p><p>What Ashton can't really do in her book is tell the story of the ordinary people who lived in Bloomsbury while all this progressive empire-building was going on. The barbers, tailors, seamstresses, knife grinders and domestic servants who scuttled around these leafy squares while their betters were busy planning for their intellectual improvement, do not make an appearance here. To find them you need to turn instead to Judith Flanders's <em>The Victorian City</em> (Atlantic, £25), a book that deals not so much with the March of the Mind as the challenge of keeping body and soul together. In Flanders's London – which rests on a rereading of Dickens's novels – the emblematic figure is Jo, the crossing-sweeper from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/history/9780141198354/bleak-house" title=""><em>Bleak House</em></a>, plying his trade in New Oxford Street, a mere stone's throw from Bloomsbury's symbolic heart, the British Museum.</p><p>Flanders writes with all five senses quiveringly alert. To take a journey with her on a train coming into Euston means to sit for ages at Camden while the conductor gets in and out of the train several times to check the tickets, there being no connecting door between the carriages. To buy a pie in the street means to watch while the pieman tosses a coin in the air: if he loses you get the pie for free. Walking past the cemetery in Portugal Street you can't avoid the stench of the badly buried dead. It is this visceral retelling of the Victorian city that makes Flanders's book the perfect complement to Ashton's more cerebral approach.</p><p>• Kathryn Hughes's biography of Mrs Beeton is published by Harper Perennial.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/society">Society</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/history">History</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kathrynhughes">Kathryn Hughes</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I was bored out of my mind in every single lesson except creative writing and drama. We had one drama class a week. I longed to be in these classes where someone was broadcasting on a frequency I understood and which inspired me. Writing my own stories. Acting in stuff we'd made up ourselves. It was wonderful. But there was pitifully little of it. Everything else was just endless clock-watching, sitting at the back, getting into trouble, creating some drama for as long as you could, till you got thrown out.</p><h2><strong>April De Angelis </strong>playwright<br /></h2><p>At primary school in the 1970s our drama teacher was the legendary <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/mar/07/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries" title="">Ivor Cutler</a>. We sang along to nonsense tunes and improvised being monkeys picking salt out of each other's skin. Once he gave us each a plastic grape for excellence. Collectively we revelled in the power of unstinted imagination. A year on at a new school I got lucky landing the part of Toad in <em>Toad of Toad Hall</em>. I loved my drama teacher, Mrs Heaton. Drama at school was the key that unlocked me with its premium on curiosity and inventiveness; the joy of working in groups yet feeling your individual input was integral. Being inside the complex world of a play with its debates, strategies, motivations and allegiances was brilliant for confidence and developing a love of language. I wasn't a kid who was taken to the theatre, so school was the place. In the school mag at the time I said the cast felt like family. Drama creates engaged, articulate beings who are attuned to their connection with others – which is why it's been suppressed – it's a political act.</p><h2><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/may/04/michael-craig-martin" title=""><strong>Michael Craig-Martin</strong></a><strong> </strong>artist</h2><p>Like most people, I consider it disgraceful that there are students leaving school without being able to read or write or do simple arithmetic, and this situation should be addressed with urgency. However because the three Rs form the basis of most well-educated people's experience of education, many make the mistake of assuming that they constitute&nbsp;the basis of all education – of education itself.</p><p>The reason why the teaching of the arts is not automatically being included in the proposed new required curriculum is that the minister and those advising him do not believe that teaching the arts is of genuine and equal educational value. They see such teaching as peripheral, a luxury rather than a necessity. They do not understand (perhaps because they never experienced it themselves) that the arts teach students important things academic education does not.</p><p>Learning by doing, by flexibility of imagination, by personal choice, learning the pleasure of hard work when what you are doing is itself a pleasure, learning by the satisfaction of personal accomplishment – these are the things that art practice teaches best, and these are the very attributes we all know young people are going to need to lead a prosperous and fulfilling life in the modern world no matter what they do.</p><p>In my experience the people who are most vociferous in their condemnation of new art, art they do not "get", are those who see themselves as well-educated. For many this is the first time in their lives that they have come up against something that does not find a comfortable place in their picture of things, something that resists their understanding. It is a very unnerving feeling, and they often dismiss the work as rubbish or the artist as fraudulent. Could it be the consequence of a failure in their education?</p><h2><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jun/29/designer-gaga-olympics-ceremony-es-devlin" title=""><strong>Es Devlin</strong></a><strong> </strong>designer</h2><p>When I was about 15 <a href="http://chrisdrury.co.uk/" title="">the land artist Chris Drury</a> took our art class into the forest. We built a giant dome out of branches. There were about 12 of us and we could all fit inside it. We told stories in the dark. We emerged from the forest the next day as new people. I&nbsp;wonder whether I would be telling stories for a living now if it weren't for this singular experience.</p><p>We rehearsed the school play in the evenings and the school became a new place, with new rules, new possibilities. I remember running anarchically down the dark corridors – running in corridors was strictly forbidden during the school day. Parents helped teachers make costumes – the terms of pupils' engagement with teachers were revised, the school became a community. I wasn't conscious of this at the time, but the sense of freedom we gained from being in the school at night time under the revised laws of the rehearsals has been something I've pursued ever since.</p><p>Britain excels in fashion, music and drama. How can we expect to perpetuate excellence if we do not cultivate the roots of these practices in children at school?</p><h2><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/gormley" title=""><strong>Antony Gormley</strong></a><strong> </strong>artist</h2><p>Had there not been an art room at the heart of my school I would not have become an artist or a whole person. The art room was always open, I could go there any time. It was a well-lit room where anything could be made, drawn, painted. I would go there several times a day to keep whatever I was doing going. "What are you trying to say?" would be the question asked by the monk/painter/art teacher: a good question. Here I was encouraged to originate things that did not exist before, that came from my own experience, thoughts, feelings and my ability to give them form. It made me examine my perceptions and value what they told me. It made me search for means and competence. This was subject matter that did not come from books, was not already known, and although from a source without authority, was my own. The fact that this was given attention, value, critical consideration gave me confidence, and when the outcome was shown in the main assembly hall it gave me an identity in the school. The other question the art master asked was: "Is it finished?" It had to be complete, and what was complete? When what I had to say was made: made into a thing that was whole, undeniable, a thing in the world. This was not an opinion or a recovered piece of general knowledge but a fact, something in and of the world that changed the world.</p><p>Imagination is a vital, precious, fundamental resource that exists in every one of us: the imagination and the power to make what has been imagined has to be valued within our schools or there will be no future. Please Mr Gove, realise that to be human is not just a matter of performing to standards but to be given the power and the confidence to make what we dream.</p><h2><strong>David Hare </strong>playwright</h2><p>In November the Guardian website posted an unforgettable film made by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ken-russell" title="">Ken Russell</a> for the BBC arts programme <em>Monitor</em> about the young author of<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/nov/21/shelagh-delaney" title=""> <em>A Taste of Honey</em>, Shelagh Delaney</a>. Anyone who watches that film about Delaney's life in 1950s Salford, and her love of the people who live there, will hear a particular tone of democratic idealism that has now disappeared almost entirely from British public life, and which, like pure music, chokes me up whenever I hear it. I hear the same tone when old film is run of the 1960s Atlanta civil rights leaders, and of Martin Luther King in particular.</p><p>What do schoolchildren need? Access to hope. And, most of all, access to convincing voices of hope. Gove's central curriculum is designed to batten down and to proscribe. It's profoundly anti-libertarian both in its programme and in its execution. The challenge for the rest of us is to make those voices accessible again, wherever they now are.</p><h2><strong>Nicholas Hytner </strong>director of the National Theatre</h2><p>Every child should get the chance to make art, and to see it at the highest standard. Growing up in Manchester, I was taken by my school and my parents to amazing stuff, and I was blessed with an array of inspirational teachers who made theatre and music central to my life. I sang Mahler and Monteverdi, I saw Shakespeare and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/orton" title="">Joe Orton</a>, I played Chekhov and the Christmas Fairy. Children from homes like mine will always do OK; it's profoundly depressing that so much is being done to discourage schools from&nbsp;introducing every child to all that's on offer.</p><h2><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/23/michael-gove-ebacc-destroy-creative-education" title=""><strong>Julian Lloyd Webber</strong></a><strong> </strong>musician</h2><p>As a nation the UK continually punches way above its weight when it comes to culture. Time after time we deliver the goods (as in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/danny-boyle" title="">Danny Boyle</a>'s wonderfully inventive Olympic opening ceremony) – but this always seems to be against the odds. Just imagine what might be achieved if we backed the arts wholeheartedly. The arts should not be the preserve of some privileged elite – all our children should be enabled to experience them. But the way the EBacc is currently framed will not allow this to happen and it needs to be changed, otherwise huge numbers of children will never be given the opportunity to realise their talents.</p><h2><strong>Antonio Pappano </strong>director of music, Royal Opera House</h2><p>At St Vincent's primary school in Westminster I was fortunate enough to have had a teacher named Mrs Walsh who played the piano beautifully, and I and my fellow students sang in a choir she led. That experience stays with me to this day as it all seemed so natural and <em>right</em>. Music was and should be a part of everyday school life. The brain needs music and the visual arts as well as reading/writing, maths and history to complete itself. The emotional intelligence that is engendered is a gift for life. The problems of the future will be solved by creative people, people whose brains are open. Music is not a privilege, it is an everyday necessity.</p><h2><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/mar/14/artsfeatures2" title=""><strong>David Pickard</strong></a><strong> </strong>general director, Glyndebourne</h2><p>Through our education work at Glyndebourne we come into contact with thousands of children of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. We see again and again how the arts enrich and sometimes change their lives, often when their families are unable to provide them with these opportunities themselves. The arts teach children so much more than simply drawing, playing an instrument, singing, dancing or acting. They teach them to think creatively; to interact effectively; to express themselves persuasively; and to believe in themselves. These skills are just as important in the world of work as the fact-based learning proposed by Michael Gove.</p><p>My own musical education has been less important for the specialised knowledge it has given me than for the creative and communication skills essential for running an organisation. My ambition to work in the arts grew out of the thrill of seeing live performance from an early age. When I was a teenager I sat on the floor of the Royal Opera House listening to Pavarotti. I was transported by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/jun/08/classicalmusicandopera1" title="">Felicity Lott</a> in <em>Capriccio</em> on the Glyndebourne Tour in Oxford. And now nothing gives me greater pleasure than seeing the reaction of schools audiences at Glyndebourne and the knowledge that another generation is being inspired in the way I was.</p><h2><strong>Elizabeth Price </strong>Turner prize-winner 2012</h2><p>My earliest memory of school is of making an abstract drawing: a kind of geometric maze. I made it using wax crayons, enjoying their luminous colours, and I was delighted with it.</p><p>I remember many different pieces of art I made during school: a poster of Jesus (wearing flares) admonishing children to put litter in bins; a powder-colour painting of a Coca-Cola bottle; a gold-foil collage of Tutankhamun. Looking back, my whole school history is charted by the pieces of art I made there. It was obviously my way of growing up, and of joining in.</p><p>I went to a secondary school where anyone could learn an instrument, anyone could join the hockey team, appear in the school play and go along to the art club. Although this extraordinarily rich educational opportunity is sneeringly referred to as a prizes-for-all culture that generates mediocrity, that wasn't my experience. I participated in all of these things, and while I was not so good at some (hockey) I found I was good at others (art and music) and I was helped to excel in them.</p><p>This was made possible through the encouragement and dedication of some charismatic and highly dedicated teachers. Also, because these subjects had equal standing with other subjects in the curriculum, I never felt that being good at art was a lesser achievement. My way of joining in was OK.</p><p>The marginalisation of art in state schools as a result of the EBacc is a truly depressing prospect, not only because so many children will have less opportunity to discover their capabilities, of finding their own way of participating in the world, but also because, as a result, art itself will be profoundly diminished. If only the privileged have access to an inspiring art education (and we all know limited resources will be directed to subjects within the EBacc, at the expense of those outside) then art will become expressive of a narrow range of social experience.</p><h2><strong>Nicholas Serota </strong>director, Tate</h2><p>I had the good fortune to be in London as a teenager in the early 60s when it was possible to see an early Rolling Stones concert as the supporting act at the Hammersmith Odeon, an explosive survey of international art in the decade 54-64 at the Tate, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Matisse+Snail&hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=rV-_UMTgMbCb1AWr1oGICg&ved=0CCQQsAQ&biw=1712&bih=1025" title="">Matisse's <em>Snail</em> </a>and <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hockney-the-first-marriage-a-marriage-of-styles-i-t00596" title="">Hockney's <em>The First Marriage</em></a> also at the Tate, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/may/11/francoistruffaut.worldcinema" title="">Truffaut's classic <em>Jules et Jim</em></a> and, slightly later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSC_production_of_A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream_(1970)" title="">Peter Brook's magical <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em></a> at the RSC. These were all touchstones that shaped my view of the world just as much as political events such as the death of Kennedy and the war in Vietnam. Culture is not an optional extra, it&nbsp;is just as much a part of life and education as maths, English, the sciences, history and a language.</p><h2><strong>Bob and Roberta Smith</strong> artist</h2><p>I went to a huge comprehensive school in Wandsworth. I imagine it's just the kind of institution Mr Gove hates. I had an amazing art education between the ages of 11 and 18. One of my teachers was Noel Hawks, who ran a record shop in Clapham High Street called Dub Vendor. Around that time I remember a large group of us trekking to east London to take part in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race" title="">Anti-Nazi Carnival at Victoria Park</a>. We saw the Clash and X-Ray Spex. The study of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/poly-styrene" title="">Poly Styrene</a> should be in the art curriculum. I came away with two experiences that I talked to Mr Hawks about: one was seeing dub innovators Aswad and the other was the surrealist and activist collage work of <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/aug2012/hear-a07.shtml" title="">John Heartfield</a>. Heartfield-inspired graphics filled Victoria Park and later Brockwell Park. All kids at school need to realise that art is free speech and rebellion.</p><p>My other art teacher was<a href="http://www.kathydalwood.com/" title=""> Kathy Dalwood</a>. She is the painter Dexter Dalwood's cousin and Hubert Dalwood's daughter. She took us on all sorts of school trips, mainly to what is now Tate Britain and the Hayward Gallery. I researched her dad and became interested in British sculpture. I loved, still love, Henry Moore from looking at his shelter drawings when I was at school. May be that's why I am so incensed about <a href="http://www.artfund.org/news/2012/12/04/sale-of-old-flo-on-hold" title="">Tower Hamlets selling the Moore sculpture "Old Flo</a>".</p><p>The most instructional experience was a school trip to the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/whitechapel-gallery" title="">Whitechapel art gallery</a> to see the Max Beckmann show that Nicholas Serota had put together. Jenni Lomax was the art education person then, and she told us, through looking at the paintings, about the Weimar republic and allegory. Later she presented us with huge sheets of paper and said forget about the paintings downstairs, just make something huge. That day was the day I thought: THIS IS FOR ME.</p><h2><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alistair-spalding" title=""><strong>Alistair Spalding</strong></a><strong> </strong>artistic director and chief executive, Sadler's Wells</h2><p>I'm afraid I'm not a good example of someone being inspired to go into the arts by my education, as we really didn't get much of a chance to develop our creative skills at the secondary school I went to. I ended up educating myself in the arts, and luckily it turned out well for me. I do not want my children's chances of enjoying or participating in artistic pursuits to be such a lottery, however. They should have a chance to at least find out whether they have musical, dramatic, choreographic or visual arts talent and, more importantly, whether they find pleasure in those pursuits. The benefits of having dance as part of a creative education are particularly obvious, as it is a performing art that enables you to express emotions and ideas but at the same time it improves your physical coordination and wellbeing.</p><h2><strong>Mark Wallinger</strong> artist</h2><p>Looking back, I realise how blessed I was to go to Manford Way junior school in Hainault, Essex. Staffed by an array of talented and eccentric teachers, many of whom had come late to the vocation, it allowed our imaginations to flourish. I owe an awful lot to Mr Holland, a polymath who could hold a classroom transfixed by reading classic children's books or get us to work out the height of the school clocktower using trigonometry, and who also took art seriously, promoting the better of us from desk to easel. He encouraged me to further what abilities I had to draw and paint – to look closely, observe and reflect, make judgments, assess and reassess. To&nbsp;draw from life is to become absorbed in a profound engagement with&nbsp;the world.</p><p>Art comes not at the expense of an academic education, nor is it about grace notes in the margins; it <em>is</em> education. But in Goveworld this might be a problem because it is impossible to measure and becomes its own reward.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/arts-policy">Arts policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove">Michael Gove</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/jez-butterworth">Jez Butterworth</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/angelis">April De Angelis</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/gormley">Antony Gormley</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/david-hare">David Hare</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/antonio-pappano">Antonio Pappano</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/elizabeth-price">Elizabeth Price</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/nicholas-serota">Nicholas Serota</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/bob-and-roberta-smith">Bob and Roberta Smith</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/mark-wallinger">Mark Wallinger</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/education">Education policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/artsandhumanities">Arts and humanities</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/artsinschools">Arts in schools</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The best books on this lifeblood of the modern economy, and environmental scourge, have tended to come from insiders such as the Pulitzer prizewinning energy economist <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/16/quest-energy-daniel-yergin-review" title="">Daniel Yergin</a>, and former BP boss <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780753827420/beyond-business" title="">John Browne</a>. But these represent the view from behind big office desks.</p><p>James Marriott and Mika Minio-Paluello, in contrast, know the industry from a decade of campaigning against it. They have taken as their subject <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2005/may/26/businessqandas.oilandpetrol" title="">BP's $4bn pipeline running from the Caspian sea to the Mediterranean</a>. They follow its route and tell an unwholesome tale of shadowy deals and displaced communities.</p><p>The "oil road" begins on the Absheron peninsula in Azerbaijan, where burning gas has leaked from the ground since the last Ice Age. This, the authors point out, is the most holy site of Zoroastrianism. "The oil-bearing rocks drew people to this place, not to extract petroleum and carry it off to some other site for burning, but to worship it here in the sheets of flame among the rocks. As other faiths arrived – Sunni and Shia Islam, Russian Orthodoxy, Marxism and capitalism – the holy fire of this peninsula was transformed into a material to be extracted and exported."</p><p>The first stirrings of the oil industry at Baku and its subsequent development under private entrepreneurs such as Ludvig Nobel (of the prize), is explained in colourful detail. We then follow the work of the Soviet technocrats. But the main story begins with BP working with the modern-day rulers of Azerbaijan – and we learn what it takes for some of the world's biggest oil companies to move 1m barrels a day through a 1,100-mile pipeline via Georgia to Turkey. In particular <em>The Oil Road</em> spells out how BP and the Azeri regime "sold" the idea to both bankers and local communities: "BP's interconnectedness with the Aliyev regime goes beyond underwriting it with revenues. The company's cooperation with the repressive regime operates on multiple levels: local executive powers in villages, the Azeri secret service, and the troops of the Special State Protection Service of Azerbaijan."</p><p>These are strong words to which BP should be given a chance to respond. I asked them myself whether they had any comments on these allegations but they declined. The authors tackle a muscular subject with a delicate touch, noting how bright yellow stakes that mark the man-made path of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline contrast with a lush landscape and draw the eye from the "leisurely" circling of a steppe eagle. A lecture on the community investment programmes run by BP across Azerbaijan is given by a clearly bored spokesperson, "her black patent three inch heels tapping insistently against the table leg".</p><p>In some of the more dramatic scenes the authors run up against rather sinister state agencies just because they are reporting in the vicinity of the pipeline. But local activists and ordinary citizens are at the centre of the story. In Qarabork, Mansura Ibishova has been involved in a dispute over BP's plans to run the BTC pipeline under her house. She refused to move: "The thought of that oil, a million barrels a day, moving at two metres per second, flowing under the kitchen at night, the baby girl in her cot, Mansura asleep, her headscarf on the dresser beside her …"</p><p>There is alarming material on the way the pipeline becomes a focus of conflict between minority groups such as the Kurds and the Turkish state. And bizarre detail on how the oil-bearing tankers sailing from the Caspian move through the pirate-infested waters of the Middle East: all monitored and ultimately defended from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwood_Headquarters" title="">Northwood HQ</a>, "an extensive underground military complex beneath an oak wood in north-west London just inside the M25". The oil from the BTC pipeline arrives in Germany and then moves on to London, home of BP and the various financial institutions that support it.</p><p>There should, though, have been more to say about how the British players at the end of this remarkable vector&nbsp;of the modern globalised economy not only keep the oil we all use flowing but subvert the debate over the need for the UK and the wider world to move quickly to a low-carbon economy. After all, global warming is a threat greater than any unwholesome embrace of autocrat and oil corporation.</p><p>Browne's 2010 book <em>Beyond Business</em> was subtitled an "inspirational memoir from a remarkable leader". <em>The Oil Road</em> is inspirational in the proper sense.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/businessandfinance">Business and finance</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/oil">Oil</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/oil">Oil</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy">Energy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/fossil-fuels">Fossil fuels</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/oilandgascompanies">Oil and gas companies</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/energy-industry">Energy industry</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bp">BP</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/terrymacalister">Terry Macalister</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She spent time in a psychiatric hospital, and took every known variant, combination and dose of anti-depressant. Nothing worked.</p><p>"I don't want to sound self-pitying, but I felt the old me had been washed away, as if there had been an avalanche, and I'd come to and found myself in a totally different landscape, so I didn't know where anything was. I just felt the old me was gone forever," she says in the first interview she's given since it struck. She can pinpoint the moment when it happened: in September 2009 she had just done an eight-day residential self-help therapy course intended, she says, to "deal with your demons", involving early starts, late nights and a giving-birth-to-yourself process.</p><p>"I thought it would be a good thing to do, because of my habitual self-loathing and the kind of unpleasantness I put myself through with my own thoughts. I thought I might find some peace from it," says Keyes. On a freezing cold day in her turquoise-painted house on a hill snaking up out of Dun Laoghaire, she's as funny and warm in person as in her books. It's just that she's talking about a rather darker side of life than might be expected for a bestselling author often dubbed the queen of chick lit.</p><p>In her 20s Keyes was an alcoholic and, after trying to kill herself at the age of 30, ended up in rehab (she now divides her life into before and after drinking). The recent depression was worse. After the course, she had about a week "of feeling really kind of elated, and then the elation began to move into shimmering, strange, manic anxiety, and then into a catastrophic fear … People looked different to me; people close to me, like Tony [her husband]. I used to have moments of thinking 'I don't know who you are'. It was horrific, like a psychotic episode that went on for a long time. Whatever they did to me in that place, it brought me face to face with my worst fears."</p><p>She tried everything, from reiki to cognitive behavioural therapy to "vitamin supplements up the wazoo", and even going to mass with her mother. "That's how bad I was. I abhor Catholicism, but I was that desperate." In the end, it was the passage of time, plus the discovery of a new hobby/obsession, baking (which led to a book of recipes) plus the slow, painful emergence of the novel that would become <a href="http://www.mariankeyes.com/Books/The-Mystery-of-Mercy-Close" title=""><em>The Mystery of Mercy Close</em></a>, which pulled her out of the pit.</p><p>Helen Walsh, Keyes's heroine in the book, is self-reliant, mean, no-nonsense, and very funny. She employs a shovel list, "of all the people and things I hate so much that I want to hit them in the face with a shovel". She's a private detective, on the trail of a missing boy band member who needs to be found before his comeback gig in less than a week. She's also seriously depressed. During the course of the novel, she makes two suicide attempts, one written with Keyes's trademark black humour, as Helen climbs off Dun Laoghaire pier, pockets laden with cans of strawberries, only to be spotted by a bunch of dog walkers. The second is much more serious, and is drawn directly from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2203593/My-midlife-meltdown-MARIAN-KEYES-tells-terrifying-story-detailing-reality-breakdown.html" title="">Keyes's own experience</a>: Helen buys a Stanley knife and makes an elaborate plan – a note in English and Polish to be stuck on the hotel room door, reading "Stop! Please don't come in. I have killed myself. You will be traumatised" – only to be talked down by her therapist.</p><p>"For a long time all I could do was read what I'd written," Keyes says. "Even when I couldn't write I'd read what I'd written and think 'how did those words come when I was feeling so bad?' It was very comforting, very encouraging … I really never thought I'd finish it, but it kept me going."</p><p>It's not the first time writing has saved her. Having studied law at university, Keyes ended up working in an accounts office in London. She started writing only in "the final few appalling dreadful months", before she gave up drinking. She began with short stories, funny, whimsical things, with no intention of showing them to anyone. "I think it was an attempt to save myself, even though I had no idea consciously what was going on, because I was heading towards some sort of terrible life-or-death choice." When she came out of rehab, she decided to try to make something of the stories. She sent them to the Irish publisher Poolbeg, adding – falsely – that she had also started work on a novel, which they asked to see.</p><p>"For the first time in my life I stepped up to a challenge. I had no idea what I was going to write. The start of <a href="http://www.mariankeyes.com/Books/watermelon" title=""><em>Watermelon</em></a> is very dramatic, I go straight into the action." The novel, told in the first person, is the story of Claire Walsh (Helen's eldest sibling; Keyes has written novels about all five of the Walsh sisters). Abandoned by her husband just after she's given birth to their first child, Claire returns home from London to Ireland and to the loving embrace of her rather eccentric family. Poolbeg gave Keyes a three-book contract.</p><p>"My confidence was so fragile that if she'd said feck off, I would have retreated into the shame of 'Jesus, who did I think I was, believing I could write a book'." She didn't think anyone outside Ireland would be interested in her stories, though, particularly when she realised that she was writing in an Irish accent. "It was very much my voice, and I thought will people outside Ireland even understand it? I thought it would be mocked for being parochial and boggery and unglamorous. I'd no idea people were perceiving it as Irish and charming, because I thought Irish meant shite, not as good as, less than."</p><p>None of her subsequent novels has come as quickly as <em>Watermelon</em>, and she rewrites and rewrites until she's happy. "It has been peaks and troughs and ups and downs, and sometimes it's been lovely and sometimes it's been like getting blood out of a stone, and actually constructing sentences is next to impossible," she says. "I feel like I've no way to talk about creativity because I'm not Salman Rushdie or a literary writer. When you're a mass-market writer, people think that you can just decide 'this happens, this happens, this happens', whereas with literary writers it's coming from their soul and their core. But with me it does come from my soul and my core, and my soul and my core often go awol, and then I've nothing to write."</p><p>Today, she has 11 novels to her name, and sales of millions around the world. If you haven't read her books, it'd be easy to dismiss them as frothy chick lit: after all, that's how they're packaged. Plus they're extremely funny, and always have a happy ending. But they all deal with difficult issues: <a href="http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780241958438,00.html" title=""><em>Rachel's Holiday</em></a> traces a drug addict's recovery in rehab; <a href="http://www.mariankeyes.com/Books/This-Charming-Man" title=""><em>This Charming Man</em></a> is about domestic violence; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/mar/04/fiction.features3" title=""><em>Anybody Out There</em></a> bereavement; <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-mystery-of-mercy-close-by-marian-keyes-8119945.html" title=""><em>The Mystery of Mercy Close</em></a> is a frighteningly real, humorous look at depression.</p><p>Keyes used to be outraged by the way her novels were lumped in with chick lit; these days, she feels much more pragmatic about it. "I used to feel misunderstood. There was one journalist, I remember her name, who described <em>Rachel's Holiday</em> as forgettable froth, and it's not," she says. "It's quite brutal. I thought it was a serious book. A comic book, but it was still a book about addiction and recovery."</p><p>The journalist, along with people who say "lay" instead of "lie", Ireland's abortion laws – an issue over which Keyes has marched – and the Catholic church are all on Keyes's own shovel list today, but she's no longer fussed about the genre thing. "There are so many bigger injustices than my little whingy thing of 'but I'm not really a pink writer, I'm not really a sparkly butterflies girl.' I've very much made my peace with it." She also believes the pink, sparkly side of life isn't to be rejected: on her website she lists her hobbies as "reading, movies, shoes, handbags and feminism". "I think it's quite OK to say you're a feminist who loves pink," she says. "Men can be men and still get excited about other men kicking a ball around and they're never mocked, whereas it's easy for women to take mocking on board, to be belittled. Because we're used to it. But I'm saying we can be all we are, we can like shoes and cake and complain about women's rights."</p><p>And there's no way she's giving up on happy endings, or comedy. "Jesus, life is hard enough. I mean, I need to have a laugh," she says. "I used to feel defensive when people would say 'yes, but your books have happy endings', as if that made them worthless, or unrealistic. Some people do get happy endings, even if it's only for a while. I would rather never be published again than write a downbeat ending. I couldn't have something permanent in the world like a book with something that accepted that life is as painful as it really is."</p><p>As for her own happy ending, Keyes seems, if not happy, at least content. "As I get older the stars have gone from my eyes more, and I see that life is just something that has to be lived with, that it's better not to struggle," she says. "I have had to lower my expectations and embrace the shiteyness, to embrace the fact that as a human being I'm nearly always going to be in a state of incompleteness or yearning or pain of some sort, or fear, because that's what human beings are … Joy is so fleeting – God, I sound such a misery guts – but for me it's not about chasing happiness or chasing joy, but to say, when it does happen, 'oh that's lovely'. To appreciate it, rather than to expect it."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/marian-keyes">Marian Keyes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/chick-lit">Chick lit</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonflood">Alison Flood</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

David Constantine's <a href="fileserver.booktrust.org.uk/usr/.../tea_at_the_midland.pdf" title="Story text (PDF)">"Tea at the Midland"</a>, which won the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/nov/29/national-short-story-award-david-constantine" title="">2010 BBC National Short Story award</a>, could be credited with having achieved that: its subject, with fateful irony, is a fierce argument over the dubious sexual tastes of a dead celebrity emblematic of the BBC.</p><p>Whatever opprobrium has been heaped on Jimmy Savile, no one has yet accused him of having sex with his pets. In that sense he had some way to go to match the carnal appetites of Eric Gill, who was revealed in Fiona MacCarthy's 1989 biography as having intimate relations with his sisters, his daughters and practically anything else that took his fancy. Yet his artistic reputation remains largely undiminished, and his iconic <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badboyuk/42849489/" title="">sculpture of Prospero and Ariel</a> still stands above the entrance to Broadcasting House.</p><p>If one were to erase all traces of Eric Gill from the BBC one would presumably also have to do severe damage to the recently restored <a href="http://www.midlandhotel.org/pictures.html" title="">Midland Hotel</a>, an art deco gem overlooking Morecambe Bay for which Gill designed a set of reliefs. In Constantine's story, a man and a woman in the tea room of the hotel are debating the works. She admires them as objects of exquisite beauty; he cannot bear to look at them. "A paedophile is a paedophile," he says. "That's all there is to it."</p><p>The woman persists: "Would you have liked it if you hadn't known it was by Eric Gill? Or if you hadn't known that Eric Gill was a paedophile?" "That's not the point," comes the reply. It's a masterful story, pregnant with fluctuating interpretations and concealed motives, in which Constantine allows the argument to erupt out of nothing. Prior to the outburst the woman has been quietly contemplating the sight of windsurfers in the bay, though even the restless, unsettled weather suggests that this relationship is doomed: "The afternoon winter sky was torn and holed by the wind and a troubled golden light flung down at all angles, abiding nowhere, flashing out and vanishing."</p><p>Constantine's prose and poetry contain many such instances of gazing out towards the horizon. It happens in a significant poem, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th56jeso6fc" title="">"Watching for Dolphins"</a>, in which a crowd of expectant holiday-makers line up on a cruise ship: "Every face after its character implored the sea / All unaccustomed wanted epiphany." And it happens often in this collection, whose protagonists are frequently loners, such as the narrator of the long tale "The Island", who exchanges life in a monastery ("being amongst monks killed even my desire to believe in God") for the greater isolation of a remote Cornish promontory: "I could hear the sounds of it, the breathing of water over shingle, and this morning I felt something had been added to my stock of resources against disintegration: an ocean entering quietly and giving bearably."</p><p>Constantine's characters are generally engaged in a losing battle to shore up their resources against disintegration. It is impossible not to be moved by undemonstrative, desperate souls such as Mr Barlow, who puts on his best suit to read poetry, despite a growing awareness that his careful routine "henceforth would not be able to hold out the flood of loneliness of the years still needing to be lived"; or the more spirited Alphonse, who breaks out of a nursing home and cycles to France knowing he only has six months to live.</p><p>But the most troubling narrative concerns a soon-to-be-defrocked canon who spends Christmas Eve in a derelict schoolhouse with a vagrant known as Goat, on account of the horn-like nubs on his forehead and delight in exposing himself. The story climaxes with a frenzied pagan dance during which "the canon unbuttoned his immaculate collar, removed it, buttoned it again and with unrepeatable sureness of aim, with the skill suddenly given you in dreams, hoopla-ed it over the risen vicar of Goat". Whatever this perverse hallucination might signify is left to the reader's imagination. But it seems a fair bet that Eric Gill would have relished coming up with the illustrations.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fiction">Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/short-stories">Short stories</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/awards-and-prizes">Awards and prizes</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alfredhickling">Alfred Hickling</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This unusual, absorbing novel has been unfairly overlooked</p><p>On 21 December 1880, the famously prolific <a href="http://www.anthonytrollope.com/" title="">Anthony Trollope</a> wrote to his son Harry: "I finished on Thursday the novel I was writing, and on Friday I began another. Nothing really frightens me but enforced idleness. As long as I can write books, even though they be not published, I think I can be happy." The novel he started that week was <a href="http://www.anthonytrollope.com/books/works/fixed_period_the_/" title=""><em>The Fixed Period</em></a> and it was published in March 1882, the last year of Trollope's life. It received mixed, somewhat baffled reviews, and sold only 877 copies, making a loss for its publisher. It has not been any more popular since then. The story is set in the future, in 1980, on an imaginary antipodean island called Britannula, and therefore lacks the subtle observation of a recognisable social world for which Trollope's fiction is cherished. It has a first-person narrator, a technique he used before only in a few short stories, and is in a style very like the urbane, sympathetic authorial persona of the earlier novels. The narrator of <em>The Fixed Period</em> is earnest and humourless. Most disconcerting of all to Trollope aficionados is the novel's subject: the effects of a law passed by the youthful Britannula Assembly making euthanasia compulsory for everybody between the age of 67 and 68.</p><p><em>The Fixed Period</em> has been largely ignored by those who go to Trollope for a superior kind of comfort reading, and dismissed as an aberrant minor work by most critics and biographers. The article on him in the <em>New Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em> describes it as "worthy of mention only as being so much out of Trollope's normal line". John Sutherland has described it as "the oddest item in all Trollope's fiction". In Trollope's oeuvre it is certainly unique, but also oddly relevant to some of our own current social, economic and ethical concerns. Due to advances in medicine and public health, Britain, like many other countries, has experienced a rapid rise in life expectancy in recent decades, which means that more and more old and retired people must be supported for longer by the working population, with a consequent rise in unemployment and fall in the value of pension funds. At the same time there is increasing public controversy and private uncertainty about the legitimacy of assisted dying in certain circumstances. It is fascinating to see an astute Victorian mind exploring these issues in the form of fiction.</p><p>In an introductory chapter, the narrator summarises the history of Britannula, an uninhabited island that was settled by a group of young emigrants from New Zealand (a country Trollope visited in 1875). The colony prospered and was granted independence by the British government. The narrator was the first speaker of its assembly, and at the time of writing is the country's president. He is a fervent advocate of the Fixed Period for rectifying "two mistakes … made by mankind; first in allowing the world to be burdened with the continued maintenance of those whose cares should have been made to cease … and the second, in requiring those who remain to live a useless and painful life." The aim of compulsory euthanasia is to convert death into a civic duty carried out with honour and dignity. For one year before their demise the old "would be prepared for their departure, for the benefit of their country, surrounded by all the comforts to which, at their time of life, they would be susceptible, in a college maintained at the public expense; and each, as he drew nearer to the happy day, would be treated with still increasing honour." It is a kind of utopian (or dystopian) version of the almshouses in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780099528654/the-warden" title=""><em>The Warden</em></a> (1855), Trollope's first successful novel. As to the expense of such a system, the narrator calculates that the savings that would accrue to the community by the elimination of its non-productive members would more than compensate. To his regret, however, this bold social experiment was thwarted before it could be put to the test, as he proceeds to relate.</p><p>This narrator is John Neverbend. Trollope liked to give some of his characters obtrusively symbolic names, wilfully violating the conventions of realism. (Henry James, who deplored the habit, said of Mr Quiverfull, the father of 14 children in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/classics/9780141199115/barchester-towers" title=""><em>Barchester Towers</em></a>, "We can believe in the name and we can believe in the children. But we cannot manage the combination.") A name such as Neverbend is, however, appropriate in a fable of this kind. He is obsessed with his vision of benign euthanasia, and unable to empathise with the growing repugnance of the population as the time draws near to put it into practice. He is deeply offended when people refer to the method to be used ("certain veins should be opened while the departing one should, under the influence of morphine, be gently entranced within a warm bath") as "murder" or "execution". He is shocked when his friend Gabriel Crasweller, who voted for the law when it was framed, shows signs of reluctance to be "deposited" in the college, and even lies about his age. Neverbend regards voluntary euthanasia as a more effective way to banish the fear of death than religion can offer, and says to Crasweller: "How best can we prepare ourselves for the day which we know cannot be avoided? … Let us turn the inevitable into that which shall in itself be esteemed a glory to us …" To which Crasweller replies flatly: "But I am nine years older than you."</p><p>Although Neverbend is humourless, for the reader there is humour, and also pathos, in the clash of his high-flown rhetoric with the instinctive reactions of others, including his own family. Neverbend is a zealot, but not an insensitive one. As the opposition to the Fixed Period grows, he actually begins "to ask myself whether I was in all respects sane in entertaining the ideas which filled my mind", but steadies his resolution by remembering the example of great men such as Galileo and Columbus, whose radical ideas were mocked and rejected in their own time.</p><p></p><p>Halfway through the book there is a long episode about a cricket match played between Britannula and a touring team from England, which gives Trollope an opportunity to indulge his penchant for amusing names (Lord Marylebone and Sir Kennington Oval) and to fantasise about the future development of the game. In 1980 it is played by teams of 16 players, with mechanical aids such as a "steam bowler" and a "catapult", which require the batsman to wear wicker helmets and other protective clothing. The match is won by Britannula thanks to Neverbend's son's innings of 1,275 runs obtained with his special "spring-bat". Trollope's speculations about other technological developments in the world of 1980 are sparse and rather timid. Transport in Britannula is still mainly horse-drawn, though Neverbend does have a steam tricycle capable of 25mph. Trollope is more prescient about communications: the British naval officers have a little device that works very like a mobile phone, and there is another which allows voice messages to be sent across oceans and emerge as text. But the novelist is not really interested in the science-fiction possibilities of his story. The cricket match is introduced mainly to provide some humour and narrative excitement, and to foreshadow a second visitation from Britain – a gunboat sent to forestall the implementation of the Fixed Period law.</p><p>It arrives in Britannula's harbour just as Neverbend is conducting the sullenly compliant Crasweller to take up residence in the College. The officer in charge of the landing-party intervenes and forbids the president to proceed, invoking the threat of the gunboat's "250-ton swiveller". Neverbend submits, vainly protesting against this exercise of brute force, and is informed that the island is to be made a Crown colony again, with a new governor to ensure that the law of the Fixed Period, unacceptable to the mother country, is repealed, while he himself must go into exile in England. The narrative we have been reading is in fact written on his voyage there.</p><p>To readers prepared to suspend their usual expectations of a Trollope novel, <em>The Fixed Period</em> is an absorbing, thought-provoking and entertaining tale. But what prompted Trollope to write it? To most of its first reviewers it seemed like an extended joke in dubious taste, but when a friend referred to it as "a grim jest" Trollope gripped him by the arm and exclaimed: "It's all true – I mean every word of it." Because of its first-person narrative method the import of the novel remains ambiguous, but the remark shows that Trollope wished it to be taken seriously. His letters at that time show him gloomily conscious of declining health. He had driven himself hard for years, getting up at five in the morning to write for three hours every day before beginning his work as a civil servant, and he was also a keen huntsman and enjoyed social life. This regime took its toll, and by the late 1870s he was overweight, short of breath, and probably suffering from high blood pressure. Two days before finishing <em>The Fixed Period</em> he wrote to a friend: "I am now an old man, 66, and shall soon have come to the end of my tether." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/victoriaglendinning" title="">Victoria Glendinning</a> quotes a letter to his brother Tom, written in 1881 or 82: "The time has come upon me of which I have often spoken to you, in which I shall know that it were better I were dead," and John Hall, editor of a collection of his letters, quotes words from another that seem particularly significant: "It will sometimes take a man more than 5 years to die." Trollope was not afraid of death, and said so emphatically to his brother: "There is nothing to fear in death – if you be wise. There is so much to fear in life, whether you be wise or foolish." What he feared particularly was evidently the living death of senility and/or physical helplessness.</p><p>It is a fear that haunts our own era. The advances in medicine that prolong our active lives also make it more likely that we will succumb to various forms of dementia, or survive a stroke for years in a helpless and barely conscious state. It is a fear to which writers are perhaps particularly sensitive, partly because they have highly developed imaginations, and partly because, like Trollope, they may become addicted to the exercise of their art and dread its withdrawal. It seems likely that he used the fable of <em>The Fixed Period</em> to explore and relieve his own anxiety by turning it into speculative fiction. Suppose a rational plan were devised to abolish the pains and problems of old age: what might it be like and how would it be received?</p><p>There is more than enough irony in the presentation of John Neverbend to prevent us from identifying his views with those of the implied author, but there is sympathy too, and Trollope allows him to argue his case logically and eloquently. The reprieved Crasweller argues effectively on the other side, affirming the human instinct to cling to life, and evoking the peculiar horror of awaiting a fixed date for one's death. Interestingly Neverbend boasts proudly to the British visitors that Britannula has abolished another institutionalised form of that suffering, "the stain of capital punishment", which makes him seem inconsistent, but more humane. At the end he feels betrayed but also secretly relieved at being removed from his invidious position, and concedes that "the Fixed&nbsp;Period, with all its advantages, was of such a nature that it must necessarily be postponed to an age prepared for it."</p><p>Trollope's odd novel proved, in one respect, uncannily prophetic of his own demise. Neverbend recalls that when the Fixed Period law was being framed there was a long debate about the age at which it should be applied. Eventually this was fixed at 67½, though some flexibility was later allowed. At the beginning of November 1882, the year in which <em>The Fixed Period</em> was published, Trollope suffered a severe stroke, which paralysed his right side and deprived him of speech, but the fate he had feared was mercifully brief. He died in a nursing home on 6 December, five months short of his 68th birthday.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/anthonytrollope">Anthony Trollope</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fiction">Fiction</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/david-lodge">David Lodge</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's a sharp and funny compendium of cooking tips and treats, from medieval times to the modern day</p><p>"If you use mutton fat for cake making," Dorothy Hartley writes, "(and it makes farmhouse gingerbread, apple cake and the homelier kinds of cake very well), beat it to a cream with the lemon juice, or a spoonful of cider, till it whips like snow."</p><p>I'd always thought of Hartley's <em>Food in England</em> as a history book, yet on rereading this endearing work from 1954, I found that it isn't, quite. I'd remembered it as being an epic account of English cooking, from medieval times onwards, interspersed with recipes. I was startled to discover that almost all of the 676 pages are taken up with practical recipes and techniques, with very little historical narrative. Hartley herself asks us to view her book as an untidy "kitchen, not impressive, but a warm, friendly place, where one can come in any time and have a chat with the cook". When she writes of blackberry junket, roast swan, capons or curds and whey, she treats them not as antiquarian curios but as delicious things that she urges us to make now. The past is not a foreign country to Hartley. It is ever-present in her kitchen, among the spices and preserving jars. The book is a compendium of favourite tips and treats, many of which just happen to be several hundred years old. "English cooking is old-fashioned, because we like it that way," she announces dogmatically.</p><p>Hartley's devotion to archaic recipes such as stargazey pie and posset sometimes comes across as mildly crazed. Marrowbone butter, she says, is excellent for "thin, nervous children". A recent BBC Four documentary on Hartley's life and work presented by Lucy Worsley cast some light on the eccentric pleasures of <em>Food in England</em>, which has been in print continuously for 58 years. As well as being a passionate independent scholar of English history, Hartley was a travel writer, photographer and illustrator (<em>Food in England</em> is peppered with her characterful drawings of such things as chestnut roasters, butter churns and her grandfather's scarlet egg cosy with a pom-pom "atop"). She seems to have had a quixotic need for solitude and sometimes hung up on friends who telephoned, snapping "I can't talk to you now. I'm in the 14th century!"</p><p>In some ways, Hartley was always in the 14th century. For 20 years, she tells us in <em>Food in England</em>, she had lived on the Welsh-English border in "a workman's cottage, with a gas-stove in one room and a log fire and pot crane in the other and cooked – as convenient – on each. It's been a happy time …" At the time she was writing, many British kitchens had started to whirr with electric blenders, Kenwood mixers and fridges. Gas stoves and grills were now ubiquitous. Yet in Hartley's world, the big news was how to scramble an egg using some of the hot ashes from a roasting fire. She writes of the curfew – an iron cover from 1500 placed over the fire to prevent it from spreading overnight – as a "modern invention". One of the book's most famous passages celebrates a "medieval pressure cooker", made by creating an airtight sealing on a cauldron with flour paste. This vessel might be used to cook a whole dinner, including a bacon joint, jars of poultry and multiple "bag puddings" of cereals and beans. It was an efficient way to cook, though Hartley warns that the pressure was sometimes too great, resulting in "demonic onslaughts" when the seal burst.</p><p>She approaches the cuisine of the past with the humour and sharpness of a journalist. A new volume from Prospect Books, <em>Lost World: England 1933-36</em>, gathers together many of the articles she wrote on food for the Daily Sketch, 20 years before <em>Food in England</em>. They are short, charming pieces on such subjects as shrimp teas, toffee apples, watercress and Kentish cherry picking. She documents the regional foods of Britain: the ones which are dying out and those that survive. With poetic longing, she describes West Country markets where you can still buy "Deep bowls of clowted cream, yellow crust top ('most yellow as butter) and underneath soft fluffy white" and "butter, every shade of gold and cream" and "Onions plaited on strings; onions, gold-papered, silver-streaked, in rough baskets; little neat pickled onions, green onions for salad".</p><p>In both her journalism and <em>Food in England</em>, Hartley is preoccupied with the town-country divide. In her view, this had a far bigger impact on the quality of food eaten than whether you were rich or poor. Elevenses, for example, were far better in the country than in towns: a "big slice of solid cake" as against some dull "tea and biscuits" in the city. To live in the English countryside, whether in the 1930s or the 1300s, was potentially to have access to wild berries and game birds, rich and varied cheeses, coltsfoot and lemon balm for medicines and mushrooms. "Country people," she wrote, "make delicious sandwiches of brown bread and butter with finely sliced up mushrooms (raw), the mushrooms being sprinkled with lemon juice." As for the complaint that country food – or medieval food, come to that – was monotonous, Hartley replied that it was "we", the moderns, who "level out the year into monotony by demanding the same food all the year round!" She was a great one for exclamation marks.</p><p></p><p>Her appreciation of English food was rare in that she started not with ingredients but with tools and techniques. Begin "at the material end", she demanded, and "study the fuel and methods first". Starting with methods meant understanding, for example, that true roast beef could only be cooked on a spit before an open&nbsp;fire. In the days of hearths and wood fires, the spits were "horizontal". With coal, they mostly became 'perpendicular'. The joint of meat needed to be dredged and basted, Hartley explains, and flavoured "with the flavour of the food the animal ate", so marsh mutton was sauced with laver weed, whereas mountain mutton was smothered in thyme. Most important was the fire itself: "meat cooks well in this radiant heat and, contrary to general belief, there is far less waste by shrinkage." Hartley lamented the moment when open fires were replaced by enclosed ovens. Perhaps, she wrote, "the best of English cooking was lost when the oven door shut on the English roast and turned it into a funereal feast of baked meats."</p><p>I shouldn't give the impression that Hartley was mindlessly jingoistic about our national food. She had travelled widely, particularly in Africa, and saw quite clearly that not everything was best at home. "Nowhere, not anywhere in England's country, have I ever had a good cup of coffee." Nor was she fond of roast turkey or rook pie; the latter was only worth making, she thought, on occasions when a large rookery had to be thinned (once more, her head was in the 14th century). But in the main, she found all that she wanted in the food of England. She relished fried cockles and bacon at the seaside; Welsh oatcakes cooked on a girdle; lardy cakes in Oxfordshire; "ancestral" apple pies; and waffles, which, she pointed out, had been made in England since the 12th century.</p><p>Rereading Hartley, it is astonishing how much practical knowledge she had of English kitchens. Worsley complains of her "lack of footnotes". But she doesn't need to cite secondary sources, in most cases, because the authority on which she writes is her own experience. She was prodigiously well informed on different English methods for making butter, for example, writing of how plunges, paddles, water wheels and dogs had all been used for churning. The latter sounds far-fetched, until Hartley explains how she used a dog churn once herself : a large wooden wheel on which the dogs ran, attached to a churn. When the job was done, the dogs were given a drink of buttermilk "and down they sit, well satisfied".</p><p>One of my favourite sections – with a very pleasing illustration – is on the different shapes used to decorate open tarts. Hartley records how apple tarts were made with wide lattices of pastry ("less likely to sink into the juicy pulp"), whereas treacle tarts were made in a gable pattern, like castle windows. "This particular pattern was&nbsp;probably as old as the first embattled castle".</p><p>To spend time in Hartley's untidy but fantastically well-stocked kitchen is to feel that the food of England past is not entirely dead. It is still alive in the pancakes we eat with lemons for Shrove Tuesday or the mincemeat and puddings of Christmas. Hartley tells us of four "local methods" for using up plum pudding, including one involving rum butter, though she observes, wryly, that "in districts where they use rum butter the contingency of any pudding being left over is unlikely". This often lonely, insular woman found in cooks of earlier times a kinship: "for we English cooks … have always been our excellent selves, under all conditions and in all centuries."</p><p>• Bee Wilson is the author of <em>Consider the Fork: A History of Invention in the Kitchen</em>, Particular Books</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/food">Food and drink</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/bee-wilson">Bee Wilson</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I never achieved it, and am fated to be almost happy in many different circumstances ..." <em>The Customs House</em> is a strong, searing and sad book. I think it is certainly Motion's most achieved collection. It signals a central change to the way he is thinking and feeling in language. He is letting the world back into him. Not the public world and restive politics of the laureateship, but a private world of understanding, humility and love. Motion is developing a late style that is far more open to possibility, one that is "almost happy in many different circumstances":</p><p>The last colour to see when the sun goes down<br />will be blue, which now turns out to be not<br />only one colour but legion – as if I never knew.<br /> ("Gospel Stories")</p><p></p><p>Edward Said believed the late style of creative artists "is what happens if art does not abdicate its rights in favour of reality". I would argue (and I have heard the poet state as much) that Motion's stint as laureate pushed him to abdicate the rights of his poetry to the reality of that public responsibility. Writing of the final poems of Cavafy, Said commended "the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris and pomposity, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained as a result of age and exile". <em>The Customs House</em> possesses and is possessed by a bare, pared-down tone stripped of hubris and unashamed of its fallibility. Motion has fully returned from the public exile of self-conscious art. He returns scorched but wiser. As with the line of English poets – <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/thomas-hardy" title="">Thomas Hardy</a>, Edward Thomas, Keith Douglas, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/philip-larkin" title="">Philip Larkin</a>, Motion himself – the mature subjectivity of tone is of course a never-to-be-realised happiness, a restlessness of feeling, a scarred understanding that yields fine, heart-rending language and the grace and pressure of precise memory:</p><p>Now wind has died in the lime trees<br />I have forgotten what sense they made,<br />but not the leaf the wind dislodged<br />that fell between my shoulder blades.<br /> ("Fall")</p><p></p><p>Motion's poetry has always possessed an affecting tonal vulnerability. It is a quality that draws a reader closer – as does his famously hushed presence when he reads in public. It is a silence made of unwritten sentences. Almost (but not quite) of self-annihilation. Yet it is also the brilliance of concentration in which both tone and image lean into each other without falling, and hold each other and proffer some slight consolation. Like his hero Edward Thomas, Motion can create images and tones of such word-carried, world-wearied sadness that you accept their truth while simultaneously believing in their fictive grace. Truth and beauty: those dissimulators. Motion used to be their master. But in poem-sequences such as "Gospel Stories", "Whale Music", "A Glass Child" and "The Death of Francesco Borromini", he is now – in his late style – humble before them. He has served his term.</p><p>Is the music of his poetry as finely judged as the tone? The first section of this book is something of an experiment. It comprises a series of war poems. These are "found poems" – which is to say (Motion notes) "they contain various kinds of collaboration". The collaborations find their origins in oral and written reportage, and in war-time stories from veterans of the world wars and the recent and current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. For example, in "The Golden Hour" (which refers to the time during which a traumatised patient has the best chance of survival), an army surgeon addresses the reader: "For instance: one patient I remember had been in a blast situation / with no visible injury but we were not ventilating very well at all.&nbsp;/ I put two openings in both sides of his chest with a big scalpel blade; / then I could stick my fingers in, and knew his right lung was down / because I could not feel it. However, I was now releasing trapped air / and the lung came up again. He has responded within the golden hour."</p><p>"Because I could not feel it." The verbal truth of the war poems is fascinating in that their poetic music is almost completely surrendered in order to honour the spoken clarity of factual experience. This requires a sensitive ear for line-break. Some of the material swings close to the prosaic, yet Motion's deft lineation and deletions work double-time to preserve the true sense of natural speech. And Motion is generous as a translator of experience. He allows the hard-won details and voices to carry their own poetry. The voices of the war poems shift from the panoptic to a microscopic focus. Tight scenes possess intense light and energy. There is no desire to press a bright-red antiwar poetry button; no call for the trickery of literature; and no call above the quiet truths and sensibilities of those on the front line. In terms of poetry and in terms of truth, <em>The Customs House</em> is an honourable, humbling achievement.</p><p>• David Morley's <em>Enchantment</em> is published by Carcanet.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/poetry">Poetry</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/andrewmotion">Andrew Motion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/poet-laureate">Poet laureate</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/david-morley">David Morley</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

By Simon Mason</p><p><a href="http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000000334,00.html" title="">Allan Ahlberg</a> has written more than 140 books. He ought to be extremely tired: I can only say it doesn't show. His latest pop-up book, illustrated by his daughter Jessica, is characteristically spry, witty, irreverent and joyous, an inventive series of variations on the Goldilocks story to be chuckled over by fortunate children and pawed repeatedly with sticky fingers.</p><p>For it's a book which demands repeated use. The daisy-chains of sweet little pictures (similar in style to those of Jessica's late mother Janet) are full of heart-warming details waiting to be spotted and shared. The stories are the same – fresh and bold, with a delightful line in wordplay. The book performs a very clever trick: honouring the original Goldilocks story at the same time as taking it apart, tossing the bits up into the air and – with a squirt of Ahlberg magic – making something new. There's a touch of the Shreks about the Ahlbergs' attitude to fairytales, and their Goldilocks riffs are adorable, anarchic and very funny.</p><p>Here – of course – is Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Here also is Goldilocks and the 33 bears (including quite a lot of skinny teenage bears in hoodies, flat-peaks and anti-fit Levis). Very nice. Then we have Goldilocks and the Three Bliim. Bliim are very like bears, except they're green with many tentacles, live in troods (spaceships) and when they get cross shout things such as: "Who's been doddering my spootz?"</p><p>In addition we have Goldilocks and the Stroppy Furniture (told from the point of view of the chair on which Goldilocks tries to sit, the bowl out of which she tries to eat porridge, and the bed in which she tries to sleep), Goldilocks and Everybody (very mad and cramped) and Goldilocks and Nobody At All (with exactly the right sort of satisfied sleepiness at the end of a very busy storytelling day). All this plus a tiny book within a book: a pantomime put on by a whole cast of fairytale characters in full make-'em-laugh, get-'em-yelling, sling-'em-free-buns style (with miniature pop-up features, of course). I particularly liked the picture of Mother Goose in dark glasses and Liz Taylor headscarf signing autographs at the stage door.</p><p>Of course, it's all about the potential of storytelling, the fun of variations: very postmodern. <a href="http://www.themodernword.com/scriptorium/queneau.html" title="">Raymond Queneau</a> would have loved it. But the fun is real fun, incredibly nifty and very warm. Though it seems at times that a story is about to spin out of control, it's always reassuringly gentle and, coming back to earth, makes perfect sense. The book never shows off its cleverness, but invites readers to share the excitement of playing with stories. The pop-up architecture isn't imposing – more Fabergé egg than St Paul's Cathedral – but it's beautiful in miniature and genuinely rewarding, with jokes and surprises of a piece with the stories themselves.</p><p>• Simon Mason's <em>Moon Pie</em> is published by David Fickling.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/childrens-books-7-and-under">Children's books: 7 and under</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fiction">Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/childrens-books-8-12-years">Children's books: 8-12 years</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simon-mason">Simon Mason</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But, Jenny Uglow argues, he is still a master of the unexpected</p><p>Crouching in a bookshop, at small-child height, in front of the picture books, I found myself laughing at familiar scenes. Here is Mrs Armitage in her rickety car, with great weights descending "kerplunk" as she hurtles along: "Bumpers? Who needs them?" Here is Mr Magnolia, with his sisters and parakeets and mice, and rhymes any two-year-old can bellow, "BOOT", "HOOT", "ROOTY-TOOT". Here is Angela Sprocket, with a pocket for everything, even the kitchen sink, and the magical Green Ship, steering into the eye of the storm. All are creations of <a href="http://www.quentinblake.com/" title="">Quentin Blake</a>. Words come to mind: exuberant, chaotic, comic – joyous.</p><p>On a table nearby are books for older children, in which Blake's drawings illuminate other people's texts. He may be benign, but he has a mercurial wit, a cartoonist's eye for the telling gesture, a spiky morality, a gleeful touch of anarchy. He can do smelliness well, such as the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2012/02/david-walliams-mr-stink.shtml" title="">matted beard and clouds of stench</a> in David Walliams's <em>Mr Stink</em>. And his long collaboration with Roald Dahl showed that he can do nastiness too: the horrible Twits, the grumpy grandmas and beastly aunts, the frightening <a href="http://www.chrisbeetles.com/gallery/literary/childrens-literature/you-dared-argue-me-screamed-grand-high-witch.html" title="">Grand High Witch with her evil drool</a>, the <a href="http://www.quentinblake.com/books/roald-dahl/9-books/roald-dahl/197-revolting-rhymes" title="">gloating red-tongued wolf of <em>Revolting Rhymes</em></a>. Yet any darkness is filtered by humour. For years now, children have seen these characters as he drew them, from the BFG in his sandals and Willy Wonka in his hat to Matilda with her tower of books.</p><p>Blake's scratchy, knobbly, angular style may be immediately recognisable, but he is still a master of the unexpected. Celebrating his <a href="http://www.worldbookday.com/2012/09/all-join-in-celebrate-quentin-blakes-80th-birthday/" title="">80th birthday </a>on 16 December, he is tetchily pleased that his new exhibition at the Marlborough Fine Art Gallery isn't a retrospective – as if he were a grand old man at the end of his career – but a show of new, intriguing, thought-provoking work. When the gallery invited him to make etchings and lithographs, he grasped the chance, even though – or perhaps because – these were unfamiliar media. Eventually, he produced mysterious etchings of women and birds and jewel-tinted humanoid insects; lithographs of girls with dogs; strange, disembodied heads of women floating in water, like archaic fragments from the depths; bouncing, vividly coloured, nude <em>Sporting Women</em>; and haunting drawings of <em>Companions</em> and <em>Characters in Search of a Story</em>. All the sequences are, he feels, "like illustration pulled inside out". Instead of pictures supporting a text, viewers provide their own narratives. The effect is unsettling, taking us to some edge, a borderland of metamorphosis.</p><p>As Blake describes it, there has always been something provisional, rather than planned, about his working life. At the end of a short video about drawing, made some time ago, he said that whenever he delivered a book, his publisher always asked if he had any ideas about what he would do next. "Well, of course I don't have any ideas – in fact I'm convinced I will never have any ideas. But I have to try, and I think about things I would like to draw. I organised an exhibition called <a href="http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/magicpencil/blake.html" title=""><em>Magic Pencil</em></a>, and there you could buy a 'magic pencil' – and I bought lots of them – of course they're not magic really, they just draw in lots of different colours – and I thought, if I drew something with them, I might find something that will make a book in the end."</p><p>I suspect that, secretly, he probably does have a magic pencil. Like Hogarth, he defies the limits of the visual by evoking sound: saucepans crash, birds screech, flutes toot. His hairy monsters, weird animals, knowing children and baffled adults threaten to leap off the paper. Noses point, arms flap, legs twist at impossible angles. In <em>Mrs Armitage on Wheels</em> he deliberately gave his heroine a scarf to blow in the wind, to impart the feeling of movement, the breath of air. Movement, freedom, escape are of the essence. And in every case, the open line and feeling of improvisation allow readers space to let their own imagination work on how characters might look and behave.</p><p>A certain liberty pervades the very way he works. His studio, the front room of his Earls Court flat, has an air of potential, as if the paper and colours and pots of pencils, the boxes and books, the notes propped on the mantelpiece, the drawers crammed with sketches, will get to work by themselves. Standing amid all this, beaming, like a slighter, slimmer version of <a href="http://www.cartoonstock.com/vintage/directory/t/twins.asp" title="">Phiz's drawings of the Cheeryble brothers in <em>Nicholas Nickleby</em></a>, Blake is enthusiastically precise about the exact make of his crayons, the quality of paper, yet hesitant about his own new work. He can be taken aback by what emerges as he draws. "If I try to think about it," he says, "there seem sometimes to have been periods of a sort of absent-mindedness when ideas think of themselves."</p><p>The air of spontaneity floats, one realises, above a lifetime of patience, graft and long-practised skills. He has the artist's demanding perfectionism, an obsessive need to "get things right". For his illustrations, he produces a sequence of roughs, working out the look of the characters, the best moments for depiction, the disposition of the page. Are the characters consistent? Does the action carry on from page to page? Next he places the sketches on the lightbox, with a sheet of watercolour paper above, and reworks them in ink, never as exact copies but transcriptions in another form. Even then he re-draws twice, three times, four, five. He likes odd tools – the random scratches of the quill, the fluid sweeps of the bamboo pen. Both are ancient tools, and both are slightly unpredictable. "You get a more adventurous feel from a scratch pen," he says, remembering how a woman in France sent him a feather from a vulture's wing, that he sharpened into a quill – "rather splendid". When he applies colour, he doesn't care if the watercolour escapes the lines: "It makes it feel as if there is something happening."</p><p>Blake has drawn ever since he can remember, certainly from the age of five. As the general view was that no one could make a living as a cartoonist or an artist, he read English at Cambridge, did his National Service and studied for a teaching diploma, and then took life classes at Chelsea School of Art. For 20 years he taught at the Royal College of Art. But during all that time he kept drawing, sending work to Punch when he was 16. In 1960, he illustrated his first children's book, <em>A Drink of Water</em>, written by his friend John Yeoman, moving from simple comedy to book illustration because he wanted to take drawing beyond the world of jokes into a realm that could embrace narrative and where he could control the sequence and design. Since then he has illustrated about 300 books, from nursery rhymes to the <a href="http://www.librarything.com/topic/114374" title="">Folio Society's <em>Don Quixote</em></a>.</p><p>He was among a new wave of British illustrators who began work in the 1950s and 60s, an extraordinary flowering, benefiting from the greater availability of four-colour half-tone printing. The brilliant artists of that generation, each with their distinctive signature, still seem fresh. It's extraordinary to find that Shirley Hughes, Judith Kerr and Peter Firmin are in their 80s, while Raymond Briggs, Helen Oxenbury, David McKee and Tony Ross were all born, like Blake, in the 1930s. A galaxy of later stars have followed and authors and illustrators have often formed notable partnerships: Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin, Allan and Janet Ahlberg, <a href="http://www.gruffalo.com/section.php?s=html/creators.html" title="">Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler</a>, and, of course, Dahl and Blake.</p><p>Blake is passionately committed to his art, a generous promoter of younger talent and a prime mover in the <a href="http://www.houseofillustration.org.uk/" title="">House of Illustration</a>, now working on establishing a permanent gallery. As the first <a href="http://www.childrenslaureate.org.uk/previous-laureates/quentin-blake/" title="">children's laureate, 1999-2001</a>, Blake encouraged all children to draw and paint, and he remains a tireless supporter of the annual <a href="http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/bigdraw/" title="">Big Draw</a>. I have seen him hold an audience of 1,200 spellbound, with children perched on adults' shoulders, just by drawing on an overhead projector, talking quietly: a nose, a line, a zig-zag, a big curve, a few more lines, and there is a crocodile balancing upside-down. He makes us feel we can all have a go. Introducing the translation of Daniel Pennac's bracingly funny <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/oct/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview28" title=""><em>The Rights of the Reader</em></a>, he speaks out against the British taste for tests and targets, as well as the constraining grid of French "dry respect for art and letters". Behind both, he wonders, "is there a sort of fear of the rich, fluid diversity of the material", of the administrator's loss of control? "How satisfying, by contrast, the reassurance of a well-ticked box."</p><p>As head of illustration at the RCA, he must have been a great teacher. Scholarly yet fluent, he writes engagingly about the traditions of his art. For the Hayward Gallery touring exhibition <em>In All Directions</em>, for example, he traced illustrators of travel from Giandomenico Tiepolo to Honoré Daumier to Edward Ardizzone and John Burningham, with detours into Japanese and Indian art. In the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008h3xp" title="">BBC's <em>Great Lives</em> series</a> he championed George Cruikshank, who drew the original Fagin and the Artful Dodger. He is entranced by moments of experiment, like the first showing of Degas's bronze <em>La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans</em>, when Parisians fled offended: "A sort of exploratory skirmish along the borders of the artificial and the real," full of inner tension and energy, a metaphor for courage.</p><p>His first independent book, <a href="http://www.quentinblake.com/books/quentin-blake/15-books/quentin-blake/112-patrick" title=""><em>Patrick</em></a>, published in 1968, was a story of art – in that case music – turning dull, monochrome lives into vibrant colour. (It was also a canny fight against being confined to black and white illustrations – to make its point, it had to be printed in colour.) In recent years, often working with the <a href="http://www.nightingaleproject.org/" title="">Nightingale Project in Kensington</a>, he has expressed this optimistic belief in the transformative power of art in his work for hospitals and health centres. These have included jubilant images of older people cavorting, playing music and swinging in trees, for a residential ward; simple scenes of walking in the rain or feeding the birds for patients with eating disorders – the balm of the ordinary; and colourful, teetering circus folk for a mental health ward for older people, a reminder that however odd they look, older people still have "skills honed over the years, still fluent and functioning". For <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/10/quentin-blake-roald-dahl-hospitals" title="">a centre for children and young people, he created Planet Zog</a>, where stalk-eyed creatures stick out spotty tongues and green consultants scribble notes: not with any solemnly therapeutic aim, but just showing people "in strange situations which they are more or less coping with". It must be brilliant to have those pictures on the walls, a friend said recently. "Whatever they show, they're so life-affirming. How could you look at them and not smile?"</p><p>For a maternity hospital in Angers, where the mood is more celebratory – though tension is there, nonetheless – Blake adopted a swimming theme, with rococo swirls of seaweed. This was not merely a reminder of the amniotic fluid or the way that newborn babies swim naturally, but a way of imparting movement and freedom, the feeling, while in labour, that "something is just around the corner". But Blake is not one for glib consolation or empty promises. His drawings of solitary figures and couples in the Marlborough Gallery exhibition are ruthless in their scrutiny, as well as compassionate. Some figures clutch small objects: a purse, a pair of glasses, a piece of paper. Exposed and anxious, they are unsmiling, and sometimes hostile. He has an affinity with lost souls, as well as a sense of fun. Michael Rosen, who has worked with Blake on many books, including the moving <em>Sad Book</em>, agrees: "I think there is a theme running through much of his work of isolated people going about some kind of slightly fantastical matter of sorting things out – Mr Magnolia, Mrs Armitage. As adults, we may well read loneliness, sadness into these but we don't know if the egocentric child reader reads these partner-less, childless people as extrapolations of themselves, in the mode of grappling with only having one shoe or disappearing cockatoos and so on. They are, more often than not, a child's dilemma blown up big."</p><p>Not all dilemmas can be solved, but Blake knows this too. His real interest, he says, is in the possibility of metaphor: "<em>Cockatoos</em> is also about adults not understanding children, <em>The Green Ship</em> about time, and of course <em>Zagazoo</em> is pure diagrammatic metaphor." The great thing is to keep on, thinking through the ideas, working on those drawings, trusting that "something may happen". In the past decade, as he explains in his recent book, <em>Beyond the Page</em>, his art has moved into public spaces, on to walls and beyond, growing first into banners and then into drawings five storeys high, wrapped around the scaffolding at St Pancras in London, and exploding on to stamps, tea-towels, wallpaper, cards. Perfectly right then that in the new exhibition he looks forward, not back, as a more decorous artist might in his 80th year. Who knows, after all, what Quentin Blake may do next?</p><p>• <a href="http://www.marlboroughfineart.com/exhibition-Quentin-Blake-New-Etchings,-Lithographs-and-Drawings-256334.html" title=""><em>Quentin Blake: New Lithographs and Drawings</em></a> is at Marlborough Fine Art Gallery, London W1, until 11 January 2013; <a href="http://www.chrisbeetles.com/exhibitions/quentin-blake-2012.html" title=""><em>Quentin</em> <em>Blake</em> <em>2012</em></a> is at Chris Beetles&nbsp;Gallery, London SW1, from 9 December to 5 January 2013.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/quentin-blake">Quentin Blake</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/illustration">Illustration</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/design">Design</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/roalddahl">Roald Dahl</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jenny-uglow">Jenny Uglow</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

For anybody ambitious or unlucky enough to be caught up in the religion-infused politics of these years – years in which the psychodramas of an ageing, corpulent Henry VIII reached a new, fevered pitch – simply surviving was an achievement. In July the previous year, Thomas Cromwell, the man whom Wyatt served, had fallen victim to a factional coup; now he was caught up in the fall-out, accused by his enemies of plotting with the king's bugbear, the exiled papal loyalist <a href="http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/cardinalpole.htm" title="">Cardinal Reginald Pole</a>. Like other political prisoners before him, Wyatt wrote for his life. In his defence, a brilliant piece of rhetorical plain-speaking, he made a simple request to the judges and jury: not to be swayed by the prosecution's bluster, but to consider the unvarnished evidence: "<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7jtMAAAAcAAJ&pg=PR53&lpg=PR53&dq=%22Sir+Thomas+Wyatt's+Defence%22&source=bl&ots=YBh50jiqW0&sig=de-iNHbm93otrX9_WNi4V12fnUI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=42TIUPDEMMrX0QXgnoD4Aw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Sir%20Thomas%20Wyatt's%20Defence%22&f=false" title="">Rehearse here the law of words</a>."</p><p>After centuries of literary-critical sneering at Wyatt's work, scholars now see him for what he was: the supreme English wordsmith of his age. Our fascination with his life continues to revolve around his association with Anne Boleyn, whose lover he may have been, and with the romantic narrator of his poems, whose anguished memory of a love now lost keeps him awake at nights: "<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174858" title="">all is turned through my gentleness / Into a strange fashion of forsaking</a>."</p><p>Wyatt's genius was known and admired in his own time. Like Cromwell, he was an <em>inglese italianizzato</em>, and his bold experimenting in English with the verse-forms and sensibilities of the Italian renaissance – he wrote <a href="http://www.sonnets.org/wyatt.htm" title="">the first English sonnet</a> – had a profound influence on our literary language. But his skill was to find a poetic voice that was at once distinctive and sinuous enough to reflect and adapt itself to the convulsive times in which he became intricately entangled.</p><p>Wyatt was audacious, charismatic and restless – qualities that resonate through his poems and which took him to the heart of high politics. Abroad, as "king's orator", his work blurred into something more shadowy: working against the enemies of the nascent English state, he was involved in distinctly undiplomatic attempts at extraordinary rendition and assassination. He also, crucially, had an instinct for survival – notably in 1532 when, along with others in Boleyn's circle, he was committed to the Tower for the first time, looking on at the executions from his cell window: "<a href="http://onthetudortrail.com/Blog/resources/thomas-wyatt-poetry-2/thomas-wyatt-poetry/" title="">The bell tower showed me such sight / That in my head sticks day and night.</a>"</p><p>In order to survive and prosper, Wyatt did what all courtiers had to do. He made politic and powerful friends, trimmed his own attitudes, opinions and religious beliefs to those that prevailed – and was ready to abandon or betray all of them at the drop of a hat. Like so many, Wyatt easily shifted his support of Catherine of Aragon to Anne Boleyn, and with it his faith; he also made a tidy sum out of the dissolution of the monasteries.</p><p>Wyatt's poems strike at the heart of the courtier's – or, more broadly, politician's – dilemma: how to remain constant, or true, or to retain any sense of perspective or self, in such a situation? "<a href="http://www.poetryclub.com.ua/readpoem_metrs.php?poem=14062" title="">Each man telleth me I change most my devise</a>, / And on my faith I think it good reason / To change purpose after the like season." But in tackling these themes, Wyatt's poems could hardly be overtly topical: in the environment in which he moved, that would have been a sure route to the executioner's block. As he put it: "It is a small thing in altering of one syllable either with pen or word that may make in the conceiving of the truth much matter of error."</p><p>Wyatt revelled in semantic slipperiness, and any account of his life and work must involve a negotiation between some of the most brilliantly evasive poetry in the English language and often hazy, historical fact: trying to connect the one to the other is an exercise in nailing jelly to a wall. As one of the foremost authorities on Wyatt and his age, Susan Brigden is of course all too aware of this. Her monumental new book, the result of many years' work, is the richest and most exhaustive study on Wyatt to date.</p><p>Very different in tone and approach to Nicola Shulman's recent and acclaimed <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/unclassified/9781780720883/graven-with-diamonds-the-many-lives-of-thomas-wyatt-courtier-poet-assasin-spy" title=""><em>Graven with Diamonds</em></a>, it comprises in large part a sequence of close textual readings of Wyatt's poems, teasing apart his language and syntax, and scrutinising them in the light of his career, his literary influences and the political and intellectual culture of the time. If this sounds recondite, it is – readers coming to Wyatt for the first time might be advised to read Shulman and Brigden in tandem – but to say this is by no means to underplay Brigden's achievement.</p><p>In tracing how Wyatt's poems emerge out of his life and times, Brigden brings to bear a vast range of literary and historical primary sources. Among the most intriguing sections of the book are those that set Wyatt in the context of his diplomatic career: Brigden has mined several European archives to bring us the fullest picture yet of his activities in war-torn Italy and imperial Spain, revealing a man who took exceptional risks on his own part and those of his king. Captured by Spanish troops outside Bologna in early 1527, he escaped weeks later by the skin of his teeth. Almost a decade on, at the court of Charles V, Wyatt's daring eloquence allowed him to tread very close to the wind indeed. At a time when the Inquisition more or less regarded all Englishmen as heretics, and submitted a number of them to the auto-da-fé – one Lutheran, John Tack, reportedly jumped into the flames as though into a bed of roses – Wyatt and his household were under intense scrutiny. The papal nuncio, the Inquisition and the Pope himself referred to Wyatt as "a demon".</p><p>Brigden's impulse to leave no archival or interpretative stone unturned can tend to result in passages that are saturated in detail and associative wordplay, yet her valuable book shows Wyatt as a master at work: a man who, in saying so much while revealing nothing, gave fullest expression to the tumultuous, paranoid world of the 1530s. Occasionally, though, this most poised of poets did let his mask slip. On 28 July 1540, as Thomas Cromwell prepared to face the executioner, he turned to bid farewell to Wyatt and to ask for his prayers.

I was curious, aroused, but scared of him, too'</p><p>When I was 20, my bible was&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Calaferte" title="">Louis Calaferte</a>'s Mechanics Of&nbsp;Women, a&nbsp;novel about desire and sex that I had found at the back of my mother's bookshelf. I was young and&nbsp;spent most of my time reading&nbsp;or creating fantasies, and I&nbsp;dreamed of meeting a&nbsp;man who felt the same as I did about Calaferte. So&nbsp;when one day my mother told me about a&nbsp;surgeon who had worked with someone she knew and who was a&nbsp;great reader and collector of erotic literature, I&nbsp;made up my mind to get in touch with him.</p><p>I made contact through Facebook, and at first it was all about books – though when I say at first, I mean the first two hours. Talk of erotic literature quickly led to more intense conversation and by that point I couldn't fool myself any longer about what was really going on, and why I&nbsp;was enjoying this kind of conversation with a&nbsp;man&nbsp;more than twice my age.</p><p>The surgeon was 46, with a wife and children, and talking to him felt&nbsp;illicit and dangerous. Twenty-five years: such an enormous gap. I&nbsp;knew he should be off-limits to me but that's what appealed. I was drawn to older&nbsp;men and to the romantic, forbidden scenarios I'd read about in books. I didn't see it as&nbsp;a father/daughter dynamic – he was a&nbsp;teacher, all right, but not in a&nbsp;fatherly way.</p><p>It started innocently enough. We talked and talked for four days. We&nbsp;got on so well, though I found it hard to be myself at first. However cheeky and confident I&nbsp;tried to sound, I felt incredibly young and impressionable. I was curious, aroused, but scared of&nbsp;him, too.</p><p>I had always loved fantasies, but the married surgeon mastering his passion for eroticism wasn't one I&nbsp;felt I could talk about with my friends. My sister Alice, who was my closest confidante, was shocked and scared when I told her about him. To her – and me – sleeping with him seemed like the most dangerous thing to do. Which only increased the attraction.</p><p>It was me who set up our first meeting, in a hotel one Monday morning, just before he started his hospital shift. I spent the Sunday night unable to sleep, impatient but anxious, too. I&nbsp;had imagined the whole scene in my head – scenes, gestures, words – but all that vanished the moment he entered the room.</p><p>He wasn't conventionally handsome, someone you would stop and stare at in the street. But what fooled – or seduced – me was the admiration I could see in his expression; the desire he seemed to have for me. And so our affair began.</p><p>At first I was sure that I was the one leading it and I shrugged off any&nbsp;tenderness he displayed. We would meet in&nbsp;hotels – and once he even took me to his clinic and I stood by his side while he was performing surgery.</p><p>Our rendezvous left me exhausted and exhilarated. But&nbsp;my attraction to him ran deeper than the sex. I was&nbsp;the eldest child, with two younger sisters; we were a&nbsp;fragmented family – my parents had divorced when I was 11 and left Paris, my mother to the south, my father to the countryside. I&nbsp;still grieved for the lost love that had once linked us all together and I&nbsp;was fascinated by this man's perfect loving&nbsp;family, his beautiful wife and three children; envious of what he and his family shared.</p><p>I knew I didn't have what it took to replace his wife, or even compete with her. Yet within weeks I was serious about him and naively thought that what we had could last for ever. At which point, with no explanation, he stopped calling or answering his phone. I think he was afraid that what we had was no longer just a&nbsp;fling but a real affair. Or&nbsp;maybe he just got bored.</p><p>Our liaison had lasted only a&nbsp;month but it took me two years to recover and move on. The only way I&nbsp;felt I could reach him was <a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781780334769" title="">by writing a book about us</a> – he was the one who got me into it.</p><p>I could have hated him a&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;times, and I tried to, but eventually I&nbsp;changed. I'm over him – almost – and I've since met a&nbsp;younger man. I&nbsp;accept this was the kind of love from which you never completely recover; I'm not sure I&nbsp;even want to.&nbsp;I learned a&nbsp;lot from him; he&nbsp;made&nbsp;me grow up.</p><p>• Do you have an experience to share?

But Plaza has never played a mere girlfriend or stock ingénue role, and admits she's less than comfortable with the idea of selling herself on her looks – for&nbsp;example, by posing for the photos accompanying this article.</p><p>"It's weird, because that's a job that some people have – they're called models," Plaza says as she curls up in a wooden chair at a kitchen table dominated by a deluxe Scrabble board while her big, friendly dog, Stevie, nuzzles her legs. "It's a skill that not everybody has. There's no photo-shoot academy. If there was, I'd probably be kicked out." As she gets up to put on the kettle for tea, she acknowledges that posing prettily is an unavoidable part of her chosen job. "I try to make it fun," she says. How? "Drugs and alcohol," she says without missing a beat.</p><p>In Parks And Recreation, Plaza's character, April, is described by curmudgeonly boss Ron Swanson as "both aggressively mean <em>and </em>apathetic". He pauses and beams. "She really is the whole package." The character's admiration reflects the real-world response to Plaza: she's a&nbsp;certain kind of guy's dream girl, authentically world-weary in an industry whose idea of a young female misfit is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/zooey-deschanel" title="">Zooey Deschanel</a>.</p><p>Plaza's character in Funny People was partially based on <a href="http://www.janeanegarofalo.com/" title="">Janeane Garofalo</a> (who worked with writer/director Apatow in the early 1990s on The Ben Stiller Show), and the younger actor/comedian has continued to draw comparisons to the Reality Bites star throughout her brief career. But Plaza represents several evolutions down the line of women who use their smart mouths to critique an industry that treats pretty girls as a&nbsp;usable resource. Part of her appeal is the way she wraps up her star power in a blanket of knowingness so dry that it almost makes you forget about the way she looks.</p><p>Her parents were 20 when she was born – "I&nbsp;was, like, a big accident," she says. "We started out with nothing, but my parents worked really, really hard, and we kind of moved up. My mom is a lawyer now, and my dad's a financial advisor." She is the eldest of three sisters.</p><p>At a young age, her mum introduced her to <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/" title="">Saturday Night Live</a>. "I became really obsessed with comedy and improv," she says. "I wanted to be on that show for as long as I could remember." Plaza was not an idle dreamer: as soon as she identified SNL as her perfect job, she set to work investigating how to land it. "Just by looking at people's biographies online, I saw that a lot of them did sketch comedy. And I decided that's what I was going to do." In high school, she enrolled at an improv school in Philadelphia, the closest major city to Wilmington.</p><p>After school, she moved to New York to study film at NYU and take improv classes at the <a href="http://www.ucbtheatre.com/" title="">Upright Citizens Brigade</a>. Soon she was performing with the likes of Rob Riggle (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115147/" title="">The Daily Show</a>), John Mulaney (later SNL's head writer), and her current Parks co-star, Aziz Ansari. She interned at Saturday Night Live in 2005, and then co-starred in a web series, <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1147740/" title="">The Jeannie Tate Show</a>, produced by Maggie Carey, wife of SNL star Bill Hader. In 2008, she finally landed an audition for SNL – and didn't make the cut.</p><p>"Then I was offered the part in Funny People." Plaza moved from New York to Los Angeles to shoot the Apatow film, assuming that she'd return to New York when the job ended and resume her place on the East Coast comedy scene. "And I never left here. I was cast on Parks And Rec and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/135879/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world" title="">Scott Pilgrim Vs The World</a>, and it was all happening back to back. So I was thinking, 'After this, I'll go back.' And then Parks just kept going. Which is a good thing, but it was kind of abrupt."</p><p>This sudden rush of success is all the more remarkable considering that in July 2005, when Plaza was 21, she suffered a stroke. She returned home to Delaware, where she underwent speech&nbsp;therapy, and battled anxiety attacks. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the summer, her parents tried to convince her to take some time off, to focus on her health, but&nbsp;Plaza was determined to get on with her life. "It was one of the scariest things that's happened, but it never felt as if it was keeping me from doing&nbsp;anything. "If anything, it&nbsp;made me more aggressive about getting things that I want. Maybe subconsciously I was feeling it was… not a&nbsp;near-death experience, but it put things in perspective."</p><p>Plaza wouldn't have been able to accomplish so much so quickly if not for unusual tenacity and ambition. Her agent, she says, saw her in The Jeannie Tate Show, "agreed to meet me for coffee, and I just harassed her. I&nbsp;sent her everything and eventually she started sending me on auditions.</p><p>"I think people just associate me with my characters," Plaza says. "But in high school I&nbsp;wasn't like that at all. I was president of everything I could be president of. I wasn't, like, the weird one making comments at the back of the class. I&nbsp;was at the front of the class. I was annoying."</p><p>Her new film, <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1862079/" title="">Safety Not Guaranteed</a>, features the 28-year-old in her first starring film role, and both plays on the expectations Plaza's fans may have of her and challenges them. She plays Darius, a graduate intern at a Seattle magazine who is still recovering from the death of her mum 10 years earlier. Desperate to, as she puts it, "eject" from her&nbsp;rut, Darius jumps at the chance to accompany two co-workers on a road trip to investigate a classified ad posted by a mystery man who claims to be in search of a partner for time travel.</p><p>The would-be time traveller is Kenneth, an intense 30-something grocer's clerk who claims to have built a time machine in his garage. Darius's boss convinces his intern to use her feminine wiles to wedge her way into Kenneth's life. "You're dangling my vagina out there like bait," Darius complains, but she gets in so deep that she falls in love with her mark.</p><p>The film was inspired by an ad in a publication geared to rural American survivalists, which then became an internet meme. Plaza was attracted to the idea of taking such a potentially easy premise for comedy and bringing depth to it: "It's such a&nbsp;thing now, people making fun of other people on the internet." It's a thing she has been a part of&nbsp;– <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1Sa9hXA4mo" title="">Plaza's impression of "controversial" comic Sarah Silverman</a> has racked up nearly 750,000 views on YouTube since she uploaded it in 2008 with the disclaimer, "I LIKE SARAH. I am a fan of&nbsp;hers. For all you haters." Today, she says, "It's&nbsp;a&nbsp;harmless thing, but I think the movie is challenging the idea of that, and the idea of people being so ironic about everything all the time."</p><p>The chatty comedy builds to a spectacular sci-fi&nbsp;climax that, despite its charmingly lo-fi production values, delivers a transcendent emotional wallop. The director, Colin Trevorrow and his star bonded over their shared love of fantasy classics such as Back To The Future and Jurassic Park. "A lot of independent films are harsh reality checks," Plaza says, "but this is an independent film with a blockbuster feeling."</p><p>Trevorrow says he and Safety's writer, Derek Connolly, "were told we could get millions more to make the movie if we recast it with bigger names. Derek and I both agreed it had to be Aubrey, and never backed down." Part of the impetus for casting her came from wanting to perform a kind of bait-and-switch on audiences expecting to get a rendition of one of her cynical characters. "A lot of people think Aubrey has one note that she can play, and we used that to our advantage."</p><p>As Plaza puts it, "Sometimes I'm viewed as the poster child for irony, so it was cool to play against that. My job was to go on that journey, and allow someone who is pure and sincere to open me up to things." That same process of transformation, she says, "is what we want the audience to feel, in the end. That it's OK to believe in positivity." She cracks up a bit on that last word, as if she is unable to argue against irony with a completely straight face.</p><p>But she seems sincere when she says, "I love great acting, as nerdy as that sounds." Her idols and inspirations tend toward the old school. She gushes about Judy Garland: "I love her as an actress. She's amazing, and her voice, obviously, it's like no other voice ever. And she's funny!"</p><p>Does Plaza ever feel that she doesn't get credit for her own work, that people just assume she's playing herself? "Yeah!" She giggles. "But also, I&nbsp;don't blame them. In some ways, that's the ultimate compliment. If people think that's me, I'm really doing it well. But the movies are opportunities to show off other things I can do."</p><p>She tries to spend all of her time off from Parks on movie sets. She'll soon be seen in Roman Coppola's <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt2044729/" title="">A Glimpse Inside The Mind Of Charles Swan III</a>, co-starring opposite <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/charlie-sheen" title="">Charlie Sheen</a>, which she calls "a crazy experience".</p><p>"I played his assistant, so it was mostly me yelling at him to get his shit together. So that was fun," she laughs. "I learned a lot from him. He's so natural, and so professional. Half the time I&nbsp;wouldn't know if he was talking to me or we were doing the scene… He's fun to be around. He's always telling crazy stories. And he doesn't care what anybody thinks about him. He's the ultimate cool guy."</p><p>She's also preparing to star with John C Reilly in Life After Beth, a zombie comedy written and to be directed by her live-in boyfriend, Jeff Baena (co-writer of I Heart Huckabees). She sums it up with a wry smile: "It's a really fucked-up movie."</p><p>Plaza is quick to admit that she doesn't get every part she wants. "People don't totally trust me yet," she laments. Safety Not Guaranteed was the rare film she was offered outright. "I still have to go after things that I want," she says, and sometimes indefatigability isn't enough – she had to pass on one of the leads in Whit Stillman's Damsels In Distress when she couldn't fit the movie shoot into her TV schedule.</p><p>"I want to be considered a well-rounded actor, not a weirdo," she says. That said, "You can't control what people think. And I can't not have some parts of what I'm doing be me, because it's all I have to use. I'm not, like, Daniel Day Lewis." She grins. "Yet. I will get there!" Despite the self-protective tinge of ironic self-awareness in her voice, I have no doubt she means it.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/comedy">Comedy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/comedy">Comedy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/comedy">Comedy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television">Television</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I know I shouldn't eavesdrop, but I can't help it. It's&nbsp;the voice. "Where's your meeting? Good luck. Bye-bye." So&nbsp;slow and deep and rich, like whipped cream mixed with gravel. Even when he&nbsp;started out 45 years ago in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en-GB&v=X-3PP7hfIm4" title="">The Graduate</a>, as virginal Benjamin Braddock about to be educated in the ways of love and lust, he had the voice. Hoffman is an extraordinarily convincing actor – when he sweats crazily in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXkqGVfm1mo" title="">Straw Dogs</a>, the sweat's for real; you can almost smell him as crippled hobo Ratso in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMoXQOmIcgo" title="">Midnight Cowboy</a>; and when he steps into a frock and heels for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlXE1Yq0AnQ" title="">Tootsie</a>, you know he's really learned to walk a lady's walk – but in the end it's down to the voice.</p><p>And to the choices he has made.

When they haven't been classics, they've been Oscar winners (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en-GB&v=KKC3W0awjm0" title="">Rain Man</a>, in which he played autistic savant Raymond Babbitt). But in recent years he's become something of a part-timer, favouring throwaway comedy (Bernie Focker in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290002/" title="">Meet The Fockers</a>), voiceovers in animated movies such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en-GB&v=GEgk9XsFCR0" title="">Kung Fu Panda</a>, or narrating documentaries.</p><p>Today, the voice is here to talk about directing more than acting. Thirty-six years after he started making his first film, Hoffman has finally completed one at the age of 75. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/11/quartet-dustin-hoffman-review" title="">Quartet</a> is a feelgood movie about a home for retired opera singers, directed with warmth and skill. Which begs the question – why has it taken him so long?</p><p>"It's one of my demons, I guess. It has been, until now," he says. By way of an explanation, he&nbsp;takes me back to the mid-70s, when he bought the rights to a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Beast-Fierce-Edward-Bunker/dp/1842432664" title="">No Beast So Fierce</a>, about a recidivist in San Quentin jail. He spent two years raising money, casting and crewing the film, by now called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYssJNxfm5M" title="">Straight Time</a>, then he started directing. And the actor who is famous for telling film-makers when they haven't got it right found he couldn't make a decision to save his life. "I did a&nbsp;take that I was in and I said, 'What do you guys think?' And the cinematographer would nod his head and say move on, the editor would say it's no good, and that happened over and over again, until finally I couldn't tell. I lost my objectivity. I&nbsp;fired myself because we didn't have playbacks." Ach, that's rubbish, he says – just an excuse. He&nbsp;fired himself because he lost his bottle.</p><p>I tell him I'd heard he'd sacked himself because he didn't have anybody to shout at. He laughs. "It's a good story, but it's not true. I don't shout as a director. I don't shout as an actor. I have been known to shout at producers and heads of studios, but I don't think it's good to shout at people who can't shout back. The shouters I dislike are what I&nbsp;call the pigeon kickers; that is, directors who yell&nbsp;at extras and people who have to take it."</p><p>Was he right to give himself the boot? "No." Why not? "Well, because people were able to make movies and be in them before me. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyv19bg0scg" title="">Citizen Kane </a>– Orson Welles didn't need a monitor, and I&nbsp;should not have let that stop me. But I did." He talks with great intensity. He listens with equal intensity, particularly to praise, which he devours eagerly.</p><p>Straight Time was eventually directed by Ulu Grosbard and released in 1978, with Hoffman in the lead. He is proud of the film, but was never asked to direct another. "I felt I'd blown the chance. I felt somehow I wasn't allowed to direct; I'm allowed to be an actor, I'm not allowed to be a&nbsp;director. We all do that; we put things off because we don't feel we're entitled to do it. Unless you're one of the few who have no demons."</p><p>Hoffman has a history of blown chances. The list of films he has failed to make is easily as impressive as those he has made. The thing is, he says, he never planned on being a movie star – and that has stuck. When he made <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36264/graduate" title="">The Graduate</a>, he was hardly a regular Hollywood hunk – short, twitchy, hamsterish – but he had an appealing diffidence, was boyishly handsome and, of course, there was the voice. Directors were queuing up to work with him, but he turned down virtually all of them. He didn't think he was right for the movies, didn't like the hoo-ha and wanted to go back to theatre. Two years later, in 1969, he returned to prominence, and a second Oscar nomination, in Midnight Cowboy. It couldn't have been a more unexpected role – after clean-cut Benjamin Braddock, here he was seedy, whiny and twisted. Mike Nichols, who directed The Graduate, asked what the hell he was doing – he had given him this great break and he was throwing it back in his face. "He called me up and said, 'Why you taking this ugly guy? That's a supporting part.' And I said, 'Well, I just like it.' Look, I started acting 12 years before The Graduate came along and made me an instant star. After that, I got scripts sent to me daily, whereas before I had none sent to me, and I just said no. There's a lot of movies I turned down."</p><p>I've heard, I say. "Yes. Yes, that's another demon. I've turned down some wonderful projects." For example? "You wanna list?" And he starts counting them out. Not the movies he didn't make, just those he regrets not making. "Ingmar Bergman, <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0066826/" title="">The Touch</a>, because my first wife was pregnant and didn't want to leave her obstetrician in New York to go to Sweden." Is that really why he turned Bergman down? "Oh. I've always had great rationalisations. They rarely are the truth. You can find reasons not to do anything." Back to the list: "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoyPu95yCxw" title="">Close Encounters</a>. Spielberg says I've turned him down more than any other actor. We finally did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxnR9e7M8Vw" title="">Hook</a> together." Blimey, you could have chosen a better Spielberg film. "I just finally had to say yes! I'm glad I did it. So there's Close Encounters, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118607/" title="">the one about slaves</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096794/" title="">a love story Richard Dreyfuss did</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwfIf1WMhgc" title="">Schindler</a>." Who would he have played in that? "Oh, Ben Kingsley's role." I tell him I'd have preferred to have seen him as Schindler's accountant. "I wish you'd tell him that." He laughs. "Yes, call him up&nbsp;now. <em>Sir </em>Ben!"</p><p>And he's back to his fingers. "Um, I turned <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/federico-fellini" title="">Fellini</a> down." Why on earth would he turn Fellini down? "That's a question I'd ask myself in later years. There is a reason." He looks embarrassed. "He didn't shoot with regular sound. He'd shoot just with a guide track because everything is dubbed there, and I thought it would compromise the performance. I said I'd pay for it to be done in direct sound, and he said no, that's not the way he worked. I love Fellini, and I turned him down." That's ridiculous, I say. He nods. "I&nbsp;always looked for reasons not to do something."</p><p>He's getting into his stride now. "I have a better one than that." I'm not sure if he's boasting or beating himself up. "Hold on a second," I say, "I've not finished with Fellini yet."</p><p>"OK," he says, "it's your therapeutic session."</p><p>"Do you think you were right to stand your ground about the sound?"</p><p>"At that time. But not now."</p><p>"When did you realise you were wrong?"</p><p>"Slowly. Slowly. It was called <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0080539/" title="">City Of Women</a>. Not one of his best films." It's as if he's still trying to justify it to himself.</p><p>Now Hoffman's champing at the bit, desperate to top the Fellini and Bergman snubs. "At one point I was supposed to meet <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/beckett" title="">Samuel Beckett</a> in a&nbsp;bar in Paris to do a revival of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot" title="">Godot</a>, and I&nbsp;stood him up. I just kept walking round the block, I&nbsp;couldn't go in the door."</p><p>You stood up Samuel Beckett, I ask, outraged. "Yes." He chuckles so quietly you can barely hear it. "I pretended, 'Oh, I didn't know it was today.'" He stops. "I wish I had known the man." He says it with longing. "Ashamed of myself."</p><p>Did you go back home to your wife and admit what you'd done? "My first wife." he clarifies. "No,&nbsp;my memory is she said, 'Don't you have an appointment today with Samuel Beckett?' And I&nbsp;said, 'No, it was just tentative, it was never set.'" When did you admit to her you'd stood him up? "Never. It was to myself, and it took a few years."</p><p>If those opportunities came along now, would you… He answers before the question is out. "Oh,&nbsp;I wouldn't be making these mistakes. Some people are alcoholics, some people are drug addicts. Some people turn down great moments in their life, and I guess I fell into that category."</p><p>I ask if it was because he was lazy, and he says no, anything but. He can only explain it in a complicated loop that takes him back to childhood. "It wasn't an excuse not to work… it was hard for me to allow myself success. I would have been much more comfortable barely making a living out of acting, which is all I expected to do. I called The Graduate a freak accident, so I think I tried to&nbsp;disown it for many, many years after that."</p><p>Hoffman was born in Los Angeles to Jewish parents – his mother, Lillian, was a part-time actress and jazz pianist, and his father, Harry, dug ditches, worked as a props man in a film studio, was made redundant the day Dustin was born, became a&nbsp;small businessman, went bankrupt and ended up selling furniture. "We had cornflakes for dinner a lot," he has said. When Hoffman starred in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089006/" title="">Death Of A Salesman</a>, he based his Willy Loman on his father. Young Dustin was a talented musician and Lillian wanted him to train as a&nbsp;classical pianist, but he preferred jazz, changed class, and soon decided he wasn't good enough to make it.</p><p>Hoffman wasn't a great student, didn't get the grades to go to university, and took up drama at junior college only because a friend told him, "They don't flunk you, it's like gym, nobody gets an F." He took to acting immediately, saying it was "the first thing I ever did that wasn't painful". He went on to study in LA at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena_Playhouse" title="">Pasadena Playhouse </a>alongside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hackman" title="">Gene Hackman</a>. He moved to New York in the 1950s, shared a&nbsp;flat with Hackman and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall" title="">Robert Duvall</a>, studied under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Strasberg" title="">Lee Strasberg</a>, did any number of odd jobs (attendant in a psychiatric hospital, waiter, dishwasher, typist, coat-man in a theatre, Times Square headline crier during a&nbsp;newspaper strike, <a href="http://www.macys.com/" title="">Macy's</a> toy salesman) and worked whenever he could in theatre. But he was&nbsp;still drowning in uncertainties. He compared his acne-ravaged face to a rifle range, he suffered from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_%28medicine%29" title="">polyps</a>, his mouth was wired with a brace and he was short. Yes, he thought he could just about make a living from acting, but that was all.</p><p>Did he think he was leading man material when he started out? "Oh my God no. My God no. You're told what you are." When he said he wanted to act, his aunt Pearl said he wasn't good-looking enough. What did casting directors tell him? "I was told I was a character juvenile." A&nbsp;character Jew or juvenile? He grins. "That's what I mean. That's the code. You're the funny-looking Jew that's alongside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="">Robert Redford</a>." Did you want to be Redford? "Before I even thought about acting, I&nbsp;saw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAlzg0S51GY" title="">Rebel Without A Cause</a> and I wanted to be <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jamesdean" title="">James Dean</a>." Why not <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/marlonbrando" title="">Brando</a>? "Brando was the icon. You had to be an idiot to think you could be Brando. Dean, you could buy a red jacket and look in the mirror. In the second year of acting class, I&nbsp;said to myself if I looked like James Dean, I could make it; that's the only thing stopping me."</p><p>He seems so plagued by doubt that I'm surprised he's so opinionated on set. Not really, he says, it's all of a piece – knowing there are options, striving for perfection. "I don't ever think there is just one way to do a scene." Ah, retakes. Hoffman is always demanding them, and he knows just how difficult that can be for film-makers. "There's nothing more insulting to a director than for them to be satisfied and want to move on, and for you to say, 'No, it's not good enough; we can do better.'"</p><p>Hoffman divides directors into two types. "Those who want to be surprised and those who don't. You can tell the directors who don't want to be surprised, because you see them mouthing the words while the scene is going on. And you know you're in deep trouble. He's shot it already in his head. He doesn't want any other intonation."</p><p>Is his reputation for being hard work deserved? "The media are lazy. It becomes the truth if you repeat it over and over." So is he difficult? He uhms and ahs. "There are a few directors I've worked with where we've clashed, but they are certainly in the minority. Some of those directors have been very verbal about it. I don't do that. I&nbsp;think it's immoral, cowardly, to wash your dirty linen in public. So I&nbsp;don't answer them in print." Well, not often. "There are directors I've fought with where the film has turned out to be very, very good." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/pollack" title="">Sydney Pollack</a>, who directed Tootsie, for example? "That's one. Basically, Sydney was not a&nbsp;collaborative director. He was a very good director, but he was the arsonist and the fire chief, and only he knew how to put out the fire. It's too bad, because there are directors who would rather fail in a film they could say was completely their own than collaborate and share the victory. It's an interesting phenomenon. And there are directors who aren't like that. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001469/" title="">Barry Levinson</a>, for example, is extremely collaborative."</p><p>He's still thinking about his reputation. "I&nbsp;was the 'difficult actor'. That was the word, 'difficult'." Actually, he says, the more he thinks about it, the more ridiculous it seems. "I live in a community where there are much more objectionable things being done than disagreeing with a director. I&nbsp;mean, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jacknicholson" title="">Jack Nicholson</a> threw a television set at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/romanpolanski" title="">Roman Polanski</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/bill-murray" title="">Bill Murray</a> picked up the producer and threw her in the water, and Gene Hackman would throw a director from one end of&nbsp;the room to another, and I always thought, why have <em>I</em> got this reputation…"</p><p>You never threw a director? He looks down at&nbsp;himself, then at me. "No, I'm Jewish! Jews usually do it by negotiation. Hehehe!" OK, we'll&nbsp;set the record straight; you're not violent or nasty, just slightly verbal. He gives me another look. "Slightly verbal? I don't know what <em>slightly</em> verbal means. If you disagree, you disagree."</p><p>The publicist walks into the room and says time is up. Hoffman looks peeved, tells her we're enjoying ourselves and we want to go on longer. Ach, he says, the industry has changed – years ago, you could natter for hours on end. Now, they expect you to do interviews in five minutes.</p><p>So we talk about the new film, and how he finally banished that demon. Unlike the first time he tried to direct, he doesn't appear in Quartet. While the film, an adaptation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Harwood" title="">Ronald Harwood</a> play, makes the point that old age is not for sissies, it is also a hymn to the human spirit. Conventional and rather old fashioned, what emerges is Hoffman's ability to get the best out of his starry British cast (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002091/" title="">Michael Gambon</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/billyconnolly" title="">Billy Connolly</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172604/" title="">Pauline Collins</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/maggie-smith" title="">Maggie Smith</a>). It's funny that somebody with your reputation has cast the fearsome Smith in one of the lead roles, I&nbsp;say. Was he scared of her? "I was forewarned." Of what? "Oh, that she can destroy you if you bullshit her, and I said, 'Well, that I&nbsp;certainly won't do.' And when we met, we sat on&nbsp;a couch and I said to her, 'I think we both have the same reputation of being hard on directors.' And she said, 'Some.' And I said, 'Yes, I can say the same thing.' And she's brilliant."</p><p>He has said he doesn't enjoy acting; it's too intense. Today, he says, he'd adore it if&nbsp;only there didn't have to be an end result. "I&nbsp;wish we never had to let the film out. I'd love acting if it was just something you went to work at every day. The same with plays: rehearsals are&nbsp;the best fun in the world."</p><p>As a director, this time round he found it easier to let go. "It was a relief to do what most directors don't do – let an actor come over who was ambivalent about his work and say, 'Have a look at the monitor, put the earphones on. If you don't like it, we'll do it again, but I think we've got it.' Directors don't let you near the monitor usually, they like to keep you subservient."</p><p>The publicist is back. Time really is up now, she says: he's got to be somewhere else. Just a bit longer, he says; there's so much to talk about. So&nbsp;he chats about his second wife, <a href="http://www.lisahoffmanbeauty.com/lisas-world/about-lisa/" title="">Lisa</a>, whom he&nbsp;married 32 years ago, the pride he takes in his six grown-up kids, his grandchildren, how he likes to spend time in London when he's not in LA. I ask if Lisa works. He grins. "Oh yeah, and now you have given me an opportunity." If you want to do me a&nbsp;big favour, he says, give her beauty company a name-check.</p><p>That's bonkers, I say, I can't just drop it in. Think of a context, he says. He's sat there, laughing, belly pushed out as far as it will go. And&nbsp;somehow he still looks good for his years. OK, I&nbsp;say, how do you look so young at 75? "Thank&nbsp;you. I use my wife's skin product… <a href="http://www.lisahoffmanbeauty.com/" title="">lisahoffmanbeauty.com</a>." And he's in stitches.</p><p>Meanwhile, the publicist is dragging him to his next appointment. "Go on, ask me your favourite question you haven't asked." Earlier this year, newspapers reported that Hoffman had <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2141122/Dustin-Hoffman-saves-man-collapsed-heart-attack.html" title="">saved a&nbsp;runner's life after he'd had a heart attack in Hyde Park</a>. "Ha!" he says, hardly saved his life. So&nbsp;what did happen? "He looks as if he's resting, and then boom! He hits the concrete and his face gets totally bloodied up and I realise something is&nbsp;wrong – his eyes are open, he's dazed, he can barely breathe, and I just happen to be the one there. So I start yelling out: 'Do you have 911 here, what's your equivalent of 911?' and someone comes over and calls it, and I say, 'I don't think you should move him.' He's on his side. The paramedics got there within four minutes. It was across the road from the Albert Hall. They come running out, they've got the defibrillator, and a&nbsp;portable cardiac thing, they cut open his shirt, they defibrillate him, it's like clockwork. Then I&nbsp;go out to get the papers the next morning and it says I&nbsp;saved somebody's life… I was there! That's all."</p><p>As the publicist ushers him out, he says that the film has been cathartic. "I've been in therapy for a number of years," he says. And that was the focus? "Yes." How long had he seen the therapist about his inability to direct? "About 10 years." With a good therapist, he says, you can achieve anything. "You know, I'd like to be in therapy even after I&nbsp;die." And, with that, he finally agrees to go.</p><p><em>•</em> Quartet is released on 1 January 2013.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/dustinhoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simonhattenstone">Simon Hattenstone</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Why are they making it expressly illegal for the Church of England and the Church in Wales to hold same sex marriages, when even senior figures in both churches are questioning it?</p><p>"The government should rethink this before they publish the legislation. Religious freedom should be protected in the legislation. But that goes both ways. Churches that want to hold same-sex marriages should be able to do so."</p><p>Cooper, who said Labour would consider amending the bill once it was published if the government did not start listening, also asked the Church of England to reconsider its opposition to the matter.</p><p>"Although the Church of England has said it does not support same-sex marriage right now I hope it will change its position in time," she said. "Parliament should not be making it harder for any church to change its mind in future – especially the established church."</p><p>The archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, said he felt the wishes of the Church in Wales had not been heeded by the government.</p><p>"We didn't even have informal contacts with officials," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. "The Church of England may have had that, but the Church in Wales certainly did not. I think we were just regarded as a kind of tag-on, as it were.</p><p>"It has put us in an enormously difficult position … It would have been nice to have some kind of consultation with somebody."</p><p>The archbishop said the church was speaking now to Miller and other officials in the hope of changing the government's mind.</p><p>"To regard the marriage of gays as a criminal act I don't think helps anybody," he said. "It certainly doesn't help the church and it doesn't help gay people either.</p><p>"It's not law yet and there is a long way to go, so I'm hoping we will be able to find a way round it that doesn't lock us in this protection."</p><p>A government spokeswoman said it was "just not true" to say that it had failed to discuss its proposals with the Church of England, and denied the church's assertion that it had not been informed of the so-called "quadruple lock" on gay marriage.</p><p>She said: "While it is inappropriate to share the exact nature of legislative proposals before announcing them to parliament, discussions with the church were quite specific about the quad lock."</p><p>The church, meanwhile, stressed the need for consultation saying it had "underlined to the DCMS the importance of church officials being able to study draft clauses before the bill is published, given the complex interaction between statute law and canon law".</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Catholic church in England and Wales said the church had nothing to add to the statement it made on Tuesday, in which it described the process behind the proposals as "shambolic".</p><p>The government proposals, which come after <a href="http:www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/26/church-radical-strategy-female-bishops-memo" title="">last month's General Synod vote against legislation to allow female bishops</a>, have disheartened many clergy campaigning for a more inclusive church.</p><p>Colin Coward, director of <a href="http://changingattitude.org.uk/" title="">Changing Attitude</a>, which works for the full inclusion of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in the life of the Anglican Communion, said he felt the row had reinforced the perception that the church was homophobic and made life far more difficult for the next archbishop of Canterbury,<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/justin-welby" title=""> Justin Welby</a>.</p><p>"I think he could have coped with the mess that had been created in the aftermath of General Synod," he said. "I think the mess that is now being created is much more difficult for even somebody as wise and skilled as him to deal with. It's easy to look at what's happening and see the church entering more and more deeply into a crisis from which it may not manage to clamber out."</p><p>Father Andrew Cain, vicar of St Mary with All Souls, Kilburn and St James, West Hampstead, and a campaigner for equality and inclusion within the church, said the struggle for equal marriage was reminiscent of the fight for women priests.</p><p>"Twenty years ago, we had no women priests; we're now debating women bishops," he said. "The whole campaign for equal treatment of gays and lesbians in the church is 20 or 30 years behind that of women. We just have to keep campaigning and eventually, the church will catch up with society - hopefully slightly faster."</p><p>The Rev Bob Callaghan, national co-ordinator of <a href="http://inclusive-church.org.uk/" title="">Inclusive Church</a>, said he was not holding his breath.</p><p>"It ain't going to happen in my lifetime as a priest," he said. "I'm 53 and I ain't going to be doing gay marriages. Come off it. We'll be lucky to have women bishops by the time I'm still ministering. But I think there is a need to keep plugging away at it."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gay-marriage">Gay marriage</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights">Gay rights</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/marriage">Marriage</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality">Sexuality</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/anglicanism">Anglicanism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion">Religion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christianity">Christianity</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/yvette-cooper">Yvette Cooper</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samjones">Sam Jones</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"We have been in regular contact with them since shortly after Jacintha's death a week ago, offering them whatever support we could and the opportunity to meet at any time," she said.</p><p>The hospital met the family "earlier in the week, and answered all of their questions in full".</p><p>On claims that Saldanha had criticised hospital staff in one of three suicide notes, she said: "No one at the hospital has seen these notes, and so we cannot comment on the reports or their accuracy."</p><p>She said, following the prank call, "hospital management offered her their support, and told her that they considered her the victim of a cruel hoax. They stood by her actions, and made it clear there was no criticism of her, and that there would be no disciplinary action of any kind."</p><p>Labour MP Keith Vaz, representing the family, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2012/dec/14/letter-keith-vaz-john-lofthouse" title="">has written to the hospital's chief executive</a>, John Lofthouse, calling for him to release the "full facts" of what happened.</p><p>Lord Glenarthur, hospital chairman, said on Friday: "We have been co-operating fully with the police and the coroner's investigation ever since Jacintha's death. We are determined to understand the full facts of what happened, and hope that everyone will join with us in assisting the coroner in the best way to achieve this."</p><p>Lofthouse said: "We will continue to do all we can for Jacintha's family. But we understand completely that whatever we do for them, it will never be enough to bring back their beloved wife and mother."</p><p>Saldanha, who was found in her nurse's quarters, had transferred the call from two DJ's posing as the Queen and Prince Charles to a colleague, who gave details of the duchess's condition hours after her admission with a very acute form of morning sickness.</p><p>Sydney police are investigating death threats against the 2Day FM DJs. A police spokesman said that they had seized a letter that contained "a number of threats". Police would not confirm the nature of the latest threat but it is thought it was directed against Michael Christian, who along with Mel Greig made the prank call.</p><p>Sydney media reported that a number of staff and senior management at the radio station had been moved into secure accommodation and given 24-hour security protection.</p><p>A spokesperson for the station's owners said: "The safety of our employees is an absolute priority. We have sensible measures in place, as we always do, to ensure our people are safe. This is now a matter for the police and we trust they will investigate any specific threats that emerge."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/king-edward-vii-hospital-hoax-call">King Edward VII hospital hoax call</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/duchess-of-cambridge">The Duchess of Cambridge</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/monarchy">Monarchy</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/carolinedavies">Caroline Davies</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alison-rourke">Alison Rourke</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

John Lewis's "never knowingly undersold" pledge means it has to match the price cuts of competitors such as House of Fraser and Debenhams which are both running major promotions.</p><p>With many households left struggling to make ends meet in the aftermath of the recession, retailers have been forced to offer increasingly large, planned or otherwise, pre-Christmas discounts. With the exception of buoyant pockets such as the West End of London, industry data suggests that the crowds in shopping malls and on high streets around the country are smaller than last year as those fearful of overspending stay home or shop online to avoid impulse buys.</p><p>Some analysts argue that central London has become a shopping "bubble" where the crowds on major shopping arteries such as Oxford Street are spending as if it is pre-recession 2007.</p><p>"We think central London seems to be living up to its reputation as a 'bubble' largely insulated from the rest of the UK," said Capital Economics' Vicky Redwood, who also suggested that the weakness of the pound was attracting high-spending tourists to the city. "Anyone walking around central London would be forgiven for questioning whether the UK has actually been in a double-dip recession. Shops are crowded and restaurants are fully booked," she said.</p><p>While mid-market chains such as Marks & Spencer have been squeezed as middle England battens down the hatches, retailers serving the top and bottom ends have fared better. Value retailers have benefited from customers "trading down", while luxury retailers, which are concentrated in central London, have benefited from the spending power of their well-heeled clients being undiminished by the financial crisis.</p><p>Last weekend retailers in the West End rang up £150m in a warm-up spending spree, with Fortnum & Mason reporting its biggest ever Saturday and Liberty also claiming a bumper weekend. Jace Tyrell, of the New West End Company, which represents shops in Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street, predicted this weekend would be huge. "Hoteliers are telling us there are a lot of tourists in London, particularly from northern Europe, and they spend a bit more," said Tyrell.</p><p>Selfridges retail director Sue West said it was a polarised trading picture, with luxury brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Michael Kors and expensive gadgetry such as tablets and headphones among its bestsellers.</p><p>Other areas were more difficult to gauge because of the blizzard of discounting in rival stores. West said there were clear signs of trading up, giving the example of a rise in goose sales of 30% in its food halls as shoppers switched to the more expensive meat.</p><p>"It's everywhere you look, in every category. Furby is one of the bestselling toys and it costs £70 to £80. People are buying fewer, more expensive gifts." A third of Selfridges shoppers are from overseas and West said demand from this group was growing more quickly than from domestic shoppers.</p><p>Retail sales growth in the capital's shopping district has outstripped the rest of the country in recent months, with London retail sales for November up 2.3% on last year, while the national figure was up by just 0.4%. Shoppers are attracted to the West End by the festive atmosphere created by the Christmas lights and the window extravaganzas of the major department stores, says Tyrell.</p><p>Harrods has gone to town this year, enlisting an army of fairytale princesses, including Rapunzel, Snow White and Cinderella, clad in ballgowns from the likes of Versace and Oscar de la Renta. "People have had five years of recession and want the feelgood factor," said Tyrell. "These stores have been doing Christmas for 100 years and there's been more investment in everything from the in-store decorations to customer service experience and the quality of the windows."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/retail">Retail industry</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/recession">Recession</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs">Consumer affairs</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/consumerspending">Consumer spending</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics">Economics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/christmas">Christmas</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/zoewood">Zoe Wood</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said he called the trades "under the counter" because "everything is totally hidden".</p><p>Another group representing large industrial users said members were concerned about the lack of "liquidity and transparency" in Britain's wholesale power markets.</p><p>The catalyst for these concerns was the revelation in the Guardian last month that the Financial Services Authority and the energy watchdog, Ofgem, were investigating allegations of market manipulation.</p><p>Erratic trading on 28 September brought complaints to the regulators from a whistleblower, Seth Freedman, and his employer, the ICIS Heren price reporting agency. Citigroup, the US investment bank, has admitted it was behind two of the low-priced trades that raised concern, although it says it was selling gas for energy clients and not on its own behalf.</p><p>The unreliability of prices quoted in the market was underlined by three major price reporting agencies giving different values for the same period of trading.</p><p>Matt Osborne, an executive at energy consultant and trader Inenco, which buys £1bn worth of energy a year for customers, said it was time to stop over-the-counter trading (OTC) with its high "risk premium".</p><p>And Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents the steel and chemical industries, said some of his members questioned the lack of "liquidity and transparency" in Britain's wholesale power markets.</p><p>There was also unease in the industry that Ofgem does not have the power to properly stamp out abuse, although it has promised to adopt tough new powers next year under the European commission's Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (Remit).</p><p>Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, has promised to severely punish anyone found guilt of market manipulation at a time when the "big six" energy companies are under fire over alleged profiteering in the retail supply sector. They deny the allegations.</p><p>Proffitt, a former executive at Pilkington glass company, said there was deep unease about the way the wholesale gas market had operated for many years using unregulated OTC trades.</p><p>"[Big energy users] have just accepted that this is the way the power sector works. I call it 'under the counter' trades because everything is totally hidden and it is anyone's guess whether rigging takes place. I would welcome everything being moved to an openly traded system on exchanges where individual transactions can be monitored and the operators [of the exchanges] would be obliged to report anything strange."</p><p>Proffitt said he did not think the FSA had the time or Ofgem the staffing power to undertake a sufficient review of the wholesale power markets, and advocated setting up a specialist watchdog with widespread powers, as in the US.</p><p>America's federal energy regulatory commission said it wanted to levy a $470m (£290m) fine on Barclays bank and banned the energy trading arm of JP Morgan Chase for six months over alleged trading irregularities.</p><p>Osborne, risk manager and trading strategist at Inenco, said it was "inevitable" that OTC trading in the wholesale gas market would eventually be brought to an end in favour of using energy exchanges such as ICE, N2X or APX.</p><p>"As a buyer of gas you need to have confidence in the prices you are paying and if you look at the wide bid offer spreads they are an embodiment of a [large] risk premium. Most other markets are exchange traded, why should energy be any different? Most people want to see more transparency and liquidity. I think it [the Guardian revelations] has been a catalyst for this kind of regulation," he said.</p><p>Nicholson said some of his members wanted to see power transactions go through a single exchange to improve volumes and price reliability, but others were happy to continue with the existing system.

Anti-monarchy campaigners claim it shows the duchy is running "a well-entrenched tax avoidance scheme".</p><p>The duchy <a href="http://www.duchyofcornwall.org/annual-report-11-12.pdf" title="">insists</a> it "is not subject to corporation tax as it is not a separate legal entity for tax purposes". But John Angel, principal judge at the information rights tribunal, ruled last December it was a separate legal body to the prince.</p><p>Accountants now believe the ruling could leave the duchy exposed to the 24% levy on profits other organisations must pay. Any change to its tax status could result in a cut to the prince's income.</p><p>Republic, the campaign for an elected head of state, has asked HMRC's anti-avoidance team to investigate whether the ruling means the duchy is now "using a highly questionable interpretation of its legal status as a means of avoiding corporation tax obligations".</p><p>A spokesman for HMRC said it would evaluate the information and "take appropriate action". There is no suggestion any law has been breached. Clarence House strongly denies claims of avoidance.</p><p>The move comes as the House of Commons public accounts committee, which earlier this month <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/716/71603.htm" title="">criticised Starbucks, Google and Amazon</a> for their "immoral" decisions to avoid paying more corporation tax, prepares to hold a hearing next year into the royal finances. As well as duchy income, last year Charles received £2.2m in grants from the taxpayer to pay for his travel by private jet, helicopter and train and the upkeep of Clarence House.</p><p>He voluntarily paid tax of £5m on his £18m income from the duchy last year, which Clarence House said was at the full 50% rate after deductions from expenses.</p><p>The duchy owns 53,000 hectares of land in 23 counties, including Prince Charles's Gloucestershire home of Highgrove. It has provided incomes to successive Princes of Wales since the 14th century. The assertion that the estate is inseparable from Charles has allowed him to use its gross profits to fund private and official spending including 26 valets, gardeners and farm staff. In the past five years he has received more than £86m from the arrangement.</p><p>But <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/nov/03/prince-charles-duchy-environment" title="">when Angel was tasked with deciding if the duchy should publish information about its environmental impact, he ruled</a> it must be considered a separate legal body to the prince because of "the differentiation of the duchy and duke in commercial and tax matters as well as under legislation and the contractual behaviour of the duchy".</p><p>The judge said: "We find that the duchy is now a body or other legal person."</p><p>Independent accountants and a firm of tax lawyers consulted by the Guardian over the claims confirmed the ruling had the potential to undermine the prince's tax arrangements, but said it was not clear-cut.</p><p>"There appears to be no legal basis on which the duchy is not taxed and there is no legal basis for the arrangement under which Prince Charles pays tax on an ad hoc basis of his own making," said Richard Murphy, who runs Tax Research LLP, and has examined the duchy's arrangements. "We have a token PR gesture from Prince Charles, not unlike Starbucks' arrangement [to pay voluntary corporation tax]."</p><p>London tax law specialist, Robert Newey, said the court ruling is "persuasive, but not binding on other courts".</p><p>"It is certainly interesting that the tribunal concluded that the duchy of Cornwall was a body for purposes of the environmental information regulations," he said. "Corporation tax applies to 'companies', but for this purpose the term 'company' has a very wide meaning. It includes any body corporate or unincorporated association."</p><p>Clarence House strongly denies any tax avoidance and said that because Charles pays income tax on money received from the duchy, "it would therefore not only be legally wrong to introduce corporation tax, but it would also result in double taxation". It said the management of the duchy is subject to supervision by the Treasury.</p><p>"His taxes are checked by the Inland Revenue, like anyone else, which reviews all his business deductions," said a spokeswoman. "In 2011-2012, the Prince of Wales paid the full amount in tax, which was almost £5m during this period."</p><p>Graham Smith, director of Republic, said: "For Charles, the duchy operates as his own personal tax haven, depriving the public coffers of millions of pounds – money that could be spent on public services.</p><p>"At a time when the country is under unprecedented economic stress it is unacceptable that the heir to the throne is avoiding his tax obligations in this way."</p><p>The renewed scrutiny of Charles's tax affairs has thrown up other possible anomalies in his arrangements. The prince's spokesman, asked about the effect of the judge's ruling, gave a different reason to the duchy for the estate not paying corporation tax.</p><p>"Only companies pay corporation tax," the palace said. "The duchy is not a company, it is a trust which was set up to generate income for Princes of Wales."</p><p>This argument presents three problems for Charles, Murphy said. It is not true that only companies pay corporation tax – HMRC's tax rules say "unincorporated associations" and "groups of individuals carrying on a business that is not a partnership" are among the categories of organisations that must pay the tax.</p><p>Also, he said, if the duchy is a trust then it should be liable for capital gains tax, which it does not pay, saying it is not liable. Finally, the beneficiary of a trust, in this case Charles, is deemed to be the owner of the assets for inheritance tax purposes which means that when Charles dies, HMRC should levy inheritance tax on the assets before they go to Prince William.</p><p>Inheritance tax – which at the current rate of 40% would be a bill of £280m – has not been levied on the duchy.</p><p>A spokesman for Charles said: "The capital assets of the duchy do not vest in the duke and pass from one duke to another in perpetuity. The Prince of Wales has no entitlement to the duchy's assets."</p><p>Background</p><p>In 1992, the Queen volunteered to pay income and capital gains tax in a deal that exempted her from paying inheritance tax of up to £20m on the Queen Mother's will. Her main tax liability comes from her investment portfolio, which includes the Balmoral and Sandringham Estates, the value of which has never been disclosed. Her expenditure on official engagements is deductible from taxable income, but her dresses are not because they are likely to serve "a personal purpose which makes it disallowable".</p><p>Prince Charles receives state grants to help pay for his official duties, but for the bulk of his costs he draws income from the Duchy of Cornwall which is taxed at normal rates after deductions for expenses. He paid almost £5m in the tax last year on an income of just over £18m. Clarence House said this was almost all at the top rate of 50% after deductions. His return is audited by inspectors from the HMRC. The taxpayer covers council tax for Royal properties that are vacant or used as staff accommodation. In 2009 it was estimated the queen paid just £1,375 in rates for Buckingham Palace because of Westminster's low tax bands. Other than the Queen and Prince Charles, the royal family pays tax in the ordinary way.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/prince-charles">Prince Charles</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/taxavoidance">Tax avoidance</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/corporate-governance">Corporate governance</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robertbooth">Robert Booth</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The effort was emotionally exacting, as he revisited every twist and agonising turn of one of the most important Himalayan expeditions in the sport's history – the first ascent of Annapurna, in central Nepal.</p><p>Annapurna was the first mountain over 8,000m to be climbed. Others were higher – such as Everest, the site of British assaults in the 1920s and 30s – but no summits had been reached. Furthermore, the geography of the Annapurna region was little known. Herzog's expedition only settled on it as an objective after first exploring the approaches to a neighbouring 8,000m giant, Dhaulagiri.</p><p>The personal cost of this triumph to Herzog, who has died aged 93, was horrific. In reaching the summit in the summer of 1950 with Louis Lachenal, Herzog's hands and feet had been frozen, and doctors had amputated all his fingers and toes. He spent months in hospital recovering from his injuries, plunged in a deep depression. Writing his book was not only cathartic but also sealed his reputation as a dynamic and courageous leader, and helped restore self-respect to postwar France.</p><p>When Paris Match put a picture of Herzog standing on the summit with the tricolour flying from his ice axe, it broke all previous sales records for the magazine. In January 1951, Marcel Ichac's film of the expedition opened in Paris, with the French president Vincent Auriol in the audience. A month later, another photograph of Herzog – this time gesturing with his ruined hands as he spoke to the film's audience – ran on the cover of Paris Match. "Our number one national hero," was what the magazine called Herzog – while failing to mention Lachenal at all. "Annapurna, to which we had gone empty-handed," Herzog wrote in his book, "was a treasure on which we should live for the rest of our days."</p><p>In 1958, Herzog became minister for youth and sport. After France's poor showing in the Rome Olympics in 1960, he was charged by Charles de Gaulle with re-invigorating French sport and inspiring a new generation, something he did to great effect. He was elected mayor of Chamonix in 1968, and headed several enterprises, including the company running the tunnel under Mont Blanc. In a 1998 memoir, he recalled suggesting to John F Kennedy the idea of the Peace Corps and meeting the biggest names of his day, including Brigitte Bardot and Juan Perón.</p><p>In 1996, Yves Ballu published his revelatory biography of Gaston Rébuffat, one of the Annapurna climbing team, and in the same year Michel Guérin published the diaries of Lachenal, previously expurgated in a 1956 publication by Herzog's brother Gérard after Lachenal's early death, but now restored. These fresh perspectives told a more complex tale of a great enterprise whose image was controlled and exploited for political and personal interests. They cast the leader in an altogether less flattering light. Herzog protested indifference, but in private was bitterly upset.</p><p>He was born in Lyon, the eldest of eight children. His father, Robert, an alpinist himself, had served in the French Foreign Legion during the first world war. The family owned a chalet at the foot of the Bossons glacier that flows from Mont Blanc, which sparked Herzog's passion for the mountains.</p><p>He passed his baccalaureate in Paris and did a postgraduate course in business studies. Towards the end of the second world war, he fought with French partisans in the Alps, first the Armée Secrète and then the leftwing Francs-Tireurs et Partisans. They made him a captain, and Herzog overlooked their affiliations. He received the Croix de Guerre and would cite the example of the resistance in celebrating the "victory" on Annapurna.</p><p>In 1945, he went to work for the tyre manufacturer Kléber-Colombes and continued with his passion for mountaineering as France emerged from the horror of occupation.</p><p>Later that decade a generation of French alpinists came to the fore, including the guides Rébuffat, Lachenal and Lionel Terray. These three formed the nucleus of the team for Annapurna, put together by the autocratic Paris-based president of the French Alpine Club, Lucien Devies. They were, however, professionals, and to maintain the amateur ideals of mountaineering, Devies appointed Herzog leader, and added Jean Couzy, an aeronautical engineer, and Marcel Schatz, a physicist. The doctor was Jacques Oudot and Ichac, already a celebrated cinematographer, would shoot the film.</p><p>Herzog's climbing record was respectable but not spectacular, and making him leader was a risk. Devies clearly had doubts about whether the guides in particular would toe the line for the greater glory of France. Two days before departing, he made them all swear an oath of allegiance to their leader.</p><p>Herzog and his team performed one of the great feats of exploratory mountaineering, trekking up the Kali Gandaki valley to examine Dhaulagiri from the east and north. The mountain was judged, in Terray's phrase, "fiendishly difficult" and so the expedition turned its attention to Annapurna, so far unseen. Just getting a view would prove surprisingly elusive.</p><p>By mid-May, the team still hadn't made progress so Herzog called a council of war at their base camp in the village of Tukucha, and with time running out before the monsoon, committed his forces to the Miristi Khola, hoping to get lucky and find a practicable route to the top. Working at extraordinary speed, and after coming to a dead end on the peak's north-west spur, the team rapidly pushed a route and a series of camps up the north face. Terray and Herzog had proved the strongest and best acclimatised, but when the supply chain stalled, Terray gave up his chance for the summit to push supplies to a high camp. Lachenal took his place at camp IV.</p><p>Wearing leather boots that offered insufficient insulation, Lachenal was anxious about his feet, not least because losing toes could threaten his livelihood. What would Herzog do, he asked, if he turned around? "My whole being revolted against the idea," he wrote in Annapurna. "I should go on by myself," he told Lachenal. "Then I'll follow you," Lachenal replied.</p><p>They reached the summit at 2pm on 3 June, and while some historians question the validity of the summit photograph, they were close enough. Herzog was in a blithe mood – his spiritual musings were a key part of his book Annapurna's appeal – perhaps boosted by the "pep pills" Oudot had prescribed to keep them going. It was in that frame of mind that soon after they began descending he removed his gloves to open his rucksack and watched "quite stunned" as the gloves slid away down the slope. The mistake would cost him his fingers.</p><p>The descent of Annapurna was a protracted and freezing horror. Terray and Rébuffat climbed up to camp IV to support them. Terray discovering a frantic Lachenal lying in the snow, desperate to get down to a lower camp so Oudot could do something to save his frozen feet. They spent the following night in a crevasse, confused and lost in a storm. Terray and Rébuffat, hunting for a route in the white-out, suffered agonising snow-blindness.</p><p>It would take six weeks for Herzog to make it home, suffering agonies in his hands, by which time his blackened feet were riddled with maggots. His serious climbing was behind him. His book, which has sold more than 11m copies, did not make him rich. The royalties went to French mountaineering, which had funded the expedition.</p><p>Herzog married Marie-Pierre de Cossé-Brissac in 1964. They had two children, Laurent and Felicité, and divorced in 1976. He had two more children, Sébastien and Mathias, with his second wife, Elisabeth Gamper, whom he married in 1976.</p><p><em>• </em>Maurice Herzog, mountaineer<em>,</em> born 15 January 1919; died 14 December 2012</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mountaineering">Mountaineering</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france">France</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news">Europe</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/eddouglas">Ed Douglas</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Two other deputies were reportedly stopped while attempting to enter parliament with pistols last week.</p><p>Although the party, which has been linked to attacks on immigrants, was quick to deny the report, police sources say the extremists have been seen carrying pistols in holsters in parliamentary committees.</p><p>Amid the turmoil of Greece's worst crisis since the second world war, tensions in parliament run high with many refusing to toe the party line in an age of austerity. After a series of physical and verbal attacks in public – MPs from across Greece's divisive political spectrum admit they are licensed gun holders.</p><p>"Many consider it an essential form of self defence," said Vasilios Kapernaros, a lawyer who represents the fiercely anti-austerity Independent Greeks party in parliament. "There's also a long tradition of terrorist attacks on politicians in this country."</p><p>A former royal palace, the sandstone building in Syntagma Square, Athens, is protected by a 250-strong police force overseen by the president of the house. Takis Kampras, who heads the speaker's press office, said suggestions that MPs posed any danger were exaggerated. "In this building the president calls the shots and no deputy can enter with a gun. The safety here is top notch. I won't say anymore but this building has its secrets."</p><p>But politiciansothers beg to differ. Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, a New Democracy MP, said that while easy access to weapons permits was considered to be "one of the privileges of being a politician", what was more worrying was the lax security in the parliament building.</p><p>"Personally I don't like guns and don't have one, but my experience from other parliaments is that security is much higher," he said. "I'm not talking about MPs, I'm talking about visitors. It's a joke and should be tightened up."</p><p>The concerns have shone a light on one of the lesser known legacies of Greece's seven-year period under military rule as revelations have emerged that MPs are neither checked nor controlled when they enter parliament.</p><p>"Out of respect for their standing as politicians they are not physically searched when they enter the parliament building," Lefteris Economou, a former public order minister who headed the Greek police, told the Guardian. "It's a hangover from the junta."</p><p>Nikos Dendias, the current public order minister, said as such it was up to MPs to use their "moral judgment" if as licensed weapons holders they entered the parliament building and decided not to leave their weapons with guards at the door.</p><p>"I am very unhappy with Minister Dendias' response," said Nikolopoulos. "When you have politicians like Golden Dawn circulating with guns this approach is totally inadequate and unacceptable. Next week I will raise the issue in parliament again,  but this time with the prime minister."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/greece">Greece</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news">Europe</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis">Eurozone crisis</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu">European Union</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu">European monetary union</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenasmith">Helena Smith</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A pre-trial hearing has been scheduled for 8 February, a fortnight before a general election.</p><p>A judge has given magistrates an additional six months to investigate whether the former premier paid Tarantini €500,000 to tell investigators he no idea that women he met through the businessman in 2009 were paid escorts.</p><p>Should the case go to trial it will follow Berlusconi's current legal battle in Milan, where he is accused of paying an underage prostitute at his so-called Bunga Bunga parties, which he allegedly started throwing after news leaked of the parties he had hosted with Tarantini in Rome.</p><p>The Milan trial, at which a procession of wome have recalled their nights with Berlusconi, was delayed on 10 December when the woman at the centre of the allegations, Karima el-Mahroug, missed a court hearing, later claiming she was on holiday in Mexico.</p><p>The likely star of a Tarantini trial would be Patrizia D'Addario, who, unlike Mahroug, claims she had sex with Berlusconi and he was aware she was a prostitute. D'Addario, who is among 25 women cited by court documents, has asked to be considered an injured party, and will seek compensation.</p><p>Berlusconi has denied ever paying for sex. Discussing D'Addario, his lawyer, Niccolò Ghedini, claimed in 2009 the former prime minister was, at most, the "end user" of the women he entertained.</p><p>Tarantini said on Thursday the women he took to Berlusconi's parties "were normal girls" and if they went to bed with the ex-premier "that was their problem". The €500,000 he received from Berlusconi was just a loan from a friend, he added.</p><p>The return to the headlines of the Tarantini investigation comes as Berlusconi appeared to reconsider his re-election efforts. In a long and sometimes confusing speech on Wednesday he said he would withdraw from the race if Mario Monti agreed to stand for office at the head a coalition that included his Freedom People party.</p><p>Monti, the technocrat prime minister who pledged to quit by the end of the year after Berlusconi withdrew parliamentary support for his government, has declined to state whether he will seek office.</p><p>Berlusconi stepped down in November 2011 amid an economic crisis and the growing row over his Bunga Bunga parties. Since then the Freedom People party has been damaged by repeated sleaze allegations which have toppled regional authorities in Lazio and Lombardy, where a fresh scandal was reported on Friday.</p><p>Twenty-two regional councillors from the Freedom People and Northern League parties are being investigated over expenses on items including lottery scratch cards, bullets, cigarettes, takeaway pizzas and fireworks.</p><p>Nicole Minetti, the Anglo-Italian former showgirl and dental hygienist who was appointed councillor by Berlusconi, is suspected of spending €832 at a Milan hotel and buying an iPad. She is also on trial accused of procuring prostitutes for the Bunga Bunga nights.</p><p>Berlusconi, 76, has, apparently, readied himself for another run for office by appearing in public with Francesca Pascale, 27, party activist from Naples.</p><p>"She is his girlfriend, everyone knows it. They are beautiful couple [and are] great together," said Mariano Apicella, the guitarist with whom Berlusconi co-wrote and recorded a collection of love songs called True Love.</p><p>"I think love has no age," he added. "Even the big stars in Hollywood have relationships with women much younger and no one says anything – why can't Berlusconi?"</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy">Italy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news">Europe</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tomkington">Tom Kington</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Germans, famously, are more direct.</p><p>"I only discovered this when I went around to an English friend's house and remarked on how I didn't like the colour scheme. I didn't mean to be cruel. I only said it because I was feeling so comfortable and at home. But I realised immediately it was a faux pas. I remember thinking afterwards, 'Why would you lie to a friend?'" Having married a Yorkshireman and landed a great job at Opera North, she has learned now.</p><p>More people in England and Wales are likely to have been exposed to German bluntness than ever before, according to the latest census results. An astonishing 273,654 German-born people are now living here – or at least were last March, when the census was carried out. That's an increase of 72,000 since 1991.</p><p>It is a somewhat misleading figure, however. Home Office statistics in 2009 revealed that 250,000 Britons were born abroad in military bases. Many of these, one can safely presume, took their first breaths in Germany and have returned home as bases have closed down in Germany since unification, or when their parents were have relocated.</p><p>The biggest clusters of German-born people tend to be in garrison towns or counties. There's Richmondshire district in North Yorkshire, home to Catterick, the biggest British army base in the world, where 2.1% of the population (1,101 people) was born in Germany. Or Wiltshire, with the biggest military community in the south-west, where there are now 6,240 German-born.</p><p>The full census data on passports held and language spoken has not yet been released. That will give us a far better picture on how many <em>real</em> Germans have made this rainy island their home. Until then, there is no scientific way of finding out how many Bavarians and Berliners really lurk on these shores  – and lurk they do.</p><p>An article in <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/krauts-in-limey-land-germans-go-eurotrash-in-london-a-357978.html" title="">Spiegel</a> magazine in 2005 noted that in contrast to many other nationalities, British-domiciled Germans "keep a low profile: they do not dominate the high street with schnitzel restaurants or corner sausage shops". Whereas Spaniards and Italians tend to gabble loudly in groups, Germans favour a more undercover approach.</p><p>While the census figures show us that many nationalities tend to live in ghettos – such as the 6,669 French in South Kensington, who make up over 4% of the London borough's population – the German-born population is remarkably well dispersed across the land.</p><p>Of non-military towns, Leeds has one of the biggest German-born populations outside London. A little over 2,800 of the city's 750,000 population hail from Germany. Ninety-four Germans work at Leeds University and a further 200-odd students matriculated last year when the census was carried out. But what about the rest?</p><p>A small number are Holocaust survivors who escaped from Nazi Germany. Edith Goldberg, 84, from Rockenhausen in western Germany, arrived in 1939 on Kindertransport aged 11, with her then nine-year-old sister. The girls' parents realised what Hitler had planned for Jews after the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938, and resolved to get their daughters to safety.</p><p>Goldberg was taken in by the Craskins, a Jewish family from Leeds who had three daughters of her own. Her sister was cared for by the Craskins' neighbour.</p><p>Aged 14, Goldberg left the Cowper Street school and went to work as a corsetmaker at Schofield's, then a famous department store.</p><p>"I remember arriving and thinking how dirty it was," she said. "We came from a small village with 52 houses and suddenly we were in this big, dirty city." For the first three weeks her sister joined Goldberg in her bed, too scared to sleep alone.</p><p>Her sister eventually left Britain, but Goldberg remained, and lives today with her Leeds-born husband. In the flat below is one of her adopted sisters from the Craskin family. Her accent is Yorkshire through and through, and though she can still read German, she claims to speak it only falteringly. Now retired, she does educational talks about the Holocaust and is a member of the Association of Jewish Refugees, but doesn't want to ever visit Auschwitz to see where her parents were murdered. "You don't have to see the place to know what happened," she said.</p><p>Helga Pearson, from Oldenburg near the Dutch border, came to Leeds in 1948. "It wasn't easy to get work in Germany after the war," she said.</p><p>From the off, everyone in Leeds was friendly, she said – "Apart from when I went to register at Pontefract police station and the officer shouted, 'I've got an alien here!'" There wasn't ever a strong anti-German feeling in the city, said Pearson. "But I always said, 'I never ever talk about politics or religion.'"</p><p>Despite a spell living in Holland, Pearson has always felt most at home in Leeds, and now lives with her Brummie husband Bill in Guiseley.</p><p>A cluster of German speakers work in and around Opera North – Klinge-Davis is customer relations manager and there is also Quirin Gerstenecker, head of campaigns.</p><p>After four years in Leeds, there are some things Gerstenecker still cannot understand about life in the north of England. "Why do English people insist on wearing so little when it is so cold?" he said, over a Glühwein at the annual German Christmas market in Leeds city centre, as a flash of bluish bare legs and arms went by. Before moving to Britain, he had a vague idea about what was in store: or at least he had heard of Leeds United and Chumbawumba ("They were big in Germany! In fact, they still are").</p><p>"I was pleasantly surprised when I came here," he said. "I had read David Peace's Red Riding books and was ready for it to be really grim up north. But it's not really. The people are lovely and I love the diversity. The one thing I will never get used to is the weather. These deep, hanging skies!

At that minute, the outside doors of the school had been locked, as part of a new security system that had just been introduced to "ensure student safety".</p><p>The staff meeting, that included the principal Dawn Hochsprung, her vice-principal and the school psychologist, began. There was plenty to talk about, <a href="https://twitter.com/DHochsprung">judging from Hochsprung's Twitter feed</a>. Fourth-graders were in final rehearsals for their winter concert; teachers were introducing a range of education apps for classroom iPads; there were new non-fiction books to be chosen.</p><p>Then five minutes into the discussions a loud "pop, pop, pop" noise was heard in the hallway right outside the meeting room. The two principals immediately stood up and rushed out into the hall to find out what was happening, accompanied by the psychologist.</p><p>According to one of the other participants in that meeting, who talked to CNN.com, only the vice-principal came back, bleeding from a gunshot wound in her foot. The principal and psychologist were later seen lying in the bloody hallway.</p><p>Within seconds, 911 calls flooded into the police dispatchers in Newtown, a serene New England community of about 25,000 located 60 miles north-east of New York City. A masked gunman was inside, the police were told, brandishing a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol targeted at some of the school's 600 four- to nine-year-olds.</p><p>The community instantly went into the kind of emergency response now familiar from similar tragedies that have become etched in America's national memory: Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, the list grows. But this kind of thing was never meant to happen here, not in sleepy Newtown.</p><p>"We always thought this was the safest place in America," said Stephen Delgiadice, whose eight-year-old daughter was in class when the shooting started but got out unharmed. He raced to the school as soon as he heard the breaking news to find out if his child was safe. He described the moment he was reunited with her. "I saw her, and it was the happiest moment of my life," he said.</p><p>Sandy Hook school was put into lockdown, as were all other schools in the region, and Swat teams rushed to the scene. Initial reports suggested two gunmen might have been involved, and armed police were sent to scour through the woods at the back of the school, though the idea of a second gunman faded as the day progressed.</p><p>Inside the school, the masked gunman, reportedly wearing a bullet-proof vest and dressed in black, was busily at work. One witness said they heard "at least a hundred rounds" being fired from the four weapons he wielded, including a Glock semi-automatic rifle and Sig Sauer handgun recovered later at the scene.</p><p>Amid the carnage that was enfolding, there was yelling in the corridors as children ran in all directions. Brenda Lebinski, the mother of an eight-year-old girl at the school, said that when the shooting started her daughter's teacher marshalled all her class into a closet.</p><p>"My daughter's teacher is my hero, she locked all the kids in a closet and that saved their lives," Lebinski <a href="http://newtown.patch.com/articles/reports-of-shooting-at-sandy-hook-elementary-school">told Newtown Patch</a>.</p><p>A nine-year-old boy told local reporters how he had been in the school gym when the horror began. "We heard lots of bangs, and we thought it was the custodian knocking things down," the boy said. "We heard screaming, then the police came in and said 'Is he here?'</p><p>"The teachers yelled at us, 'Get into the closet,' and we sat in there for a little while. Then the police knocked on the door and said, 'We're evacuating, we're evacuating, this way, this way.'"</p><p>Another girl, aged eight, hid with her teacher in a bathroom. The teacher tried to comfort the child by telling her the noise was nothing to worry about; that it was just the sound of builders hammering.</p><p>Alexis Wasik described the fear that engulfed her in terms that only an eight-year-old could. "It was really frightening. Some people felt they had a stomach ache," she said.</p><p>When Swat teams arrived at the school by 9.45am they entered the building and began an "active shooter search", checking every door and every crack of the school in the race against the clock to stop the gunman and contain the body count.</p><p>Police began ushering pupils out of the school, long lines of children snaking into the daylight, their brightly coloured jeans and T-shirts looking far too cheery for the circumstances. They were taken to the voluntary fire station adjacent to the school, where hundreds of anxious parents began to arrive, having been by alerted by automatic robocall. They filed into the fire house, some to experience the ecstatic relief of reunion, others to have their lives forever shattered in a moment by the worst news a parent can be told.</p><p>Within the hour, it was announced that the gunman was dead, his corpse left inside the school awaiting forensic investigations. The public was no longer in danger, said the local police chief, Lt Paul Vance. But though the gunman's business was over, the pain and the terror he left behind had only just begun to be felt across America. A dawning awareness rippled out from Sandy Hook elementary that a catastrophe of unimaginable brutality and on an historic scale had taken place there.</p><p>At first it was thought just the gunman had died, then details emerged that there had been injuries, then reports of a couple of adults had died, then the first heartrending mention of children who had perished, then the chilling citing of statistics that in turn rose in spluttering bursts to a numbing 27 dead including 20 children.</p><p>As the world's media began to congregate in this previously news-less town, reporters could see parents running down the lane that leads away from the school, clutching their children in their arms. One mother screamed out as she ran the words everyone was thinking: "Why? Why? Why?"</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control">US gun control</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington">Ed Pilkington</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I offered Governor Malloy my condolences on behalf of the nation, and made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, counsel their families.<br /> <br />We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news I react not as a President, but as anybody else would – as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. </p><p>The majority of those who died today were children – beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them – birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers – men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. </p><p>So our hearts are broken today – for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain. </p><p>As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago – these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.</p><p>This evening, Michelle and I will do what I know every parent in America will do, which is hug our children a little tighter and we'll tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in Connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as Americans. And I will do everything in my power as President to help.</p><p>Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need – to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours.</p><p>May God bless the memory of the victims and, in the words of Scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control">US gun control</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa">United States</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The gunman, who is believed to have carried out the attack alone, is also dead.</p><p>State police lieutenant Paul Vance said 18 children died at the scene, and two more died in hospital. In addition to the six adults found dead at the school, another individual who lived with the gunman was also killed at second location.</p><p>Sandy Hook teaches children from kindergarten to fourth grade, ages five to 10.</p><p>The scale of the tragedy and the age of the victims shocked a country that has seen many mass shootings, and prompted immediate calls for tougher gun controls. But Barack Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, refused to engage with the issue, telling reporters at a White House briefing that "today was not the day".</p><p>But later, in an emotional press conference at the White House, Barack Obama suggested that he may take action. Fighting back tears, he said: "We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news I react not as a president, but as anybody else would – as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do."</p><p>He continued: "Whether it's an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago – these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."</p><p>The gunman was understood to be in his 20s. It is understood that his mother was a teacher at the school. He killed her, then shot all 18 children in her class, according to the Associated Press and the New York Times. </p><p>Police said they could not confirm those details, but Vance said the shootings all took place in one section of the school. </p><p>Pictures of the immediate aftermath of the shooting showed surviving children, many of them visibly upset, being ushered away from the building. Some told their parents  they had been told by the police officers evacuating the school to close their eyes when passing certain rooms. </p><p>As news of the shooting began to circulate, parents were seen running toward the building to find out if their children were amongst those shot. </p><p>Police said the first 911 call came just after 9.30am. As all schools were put on lockdown as a precaution, state and local officers responded to the scene and immediately entered the building to begin a thorough search of all classrooms. </p><p>"Our main objective was to evacuate … any and all students and faculty," Vance told reporters.</p><p>Young children at Sandy Hook gave chilling accounts of the shooting to their parents. Richard Wilford's seven-year-old son, Richie, told of hearing a noise that sounded like cans falling at the time of the attack.</p><p>"I could try to explain it, but I'm sure I would fail," said Wilford. "There's no words that I could come up with that would even come close to describing the sheer terror of hearing that your son is in a place, or your child's in a place, where there's been violence. </p><p>"You don't know the details of that violence, you don't know the condition of your child and you can't do anything to immediately help them or protect them. It is a powerless and terrifying experience." </p><p>Robert Licata said his six-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher.</p><p>"That's when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door," he told the AP. "He was very brave. He waited for his friends."</p><p>Licata said the shooter didn't say a word.</p><p>Stephen Delgiadice said his eight-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was fine.</p><p>"It's alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America," he said.</p><p>The shooting comes towards the end of a year that has seen a number of mass shootings including an assault at a movie theatre in Colorado that killed 12 people and an attack at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that took the lives of six worshipers. On Monday, two people were killed by a gunman at a shopping mall in Portland, Oregon.</p><p>Obama also spoke by phone to Governor Malloy who had travelled to the scene.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime">US crime</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams">Matt Williams</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In some branches the boxes of cash being deposited were so big the tellers' windows had to be enlarged.</p><p>Chief executive Stuart Gulliver insists the bank is now under new management and will not make the same mistakes again – although both he and chairman Douglas Flint were in top roles while the money laundering activities were still going on. Gulliver and Flint are now giving more responsibility to group business heads – ending the policy that country heads of the bank's outposts around the world should be "kings" of their businesses.</p><p>The US authorities said HSBC did not face criminal charges because the bank was too big to prosecute and no individuals were implicated. So where are the bosses who presided over HSBC's years as banker to drug lords, terrorists and rogue states ?</p><p></p><p><strong>1. Sir John Bond </strong></p><p>Left HSBC in 2006 after 45 years. He was chairman of the bank between 1998 to 2006 and chief executive before that from 1998. After quitting the bank he became chairman of other major companies, including telecoms company Vodafone (until 2011) and mining company Xstrata. Last month he promised to step down from that role when shareholders rebelled against his plan to reward Xstrata's top bosses with special bonuses totalling £170m as part of a plan to merge with rival Glencore.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Stephen Green</strong></p><p>Left HSBC at the end of 2010 to take up a seat in the Lords and become a trade minister for the coalition government. He was chief executive of HSBC between 2003 and 2006 when he was promoted to chairman, the role he held until he joined the government. He is also a lay preacher and retains his role as a trade minister</p><p><strong>3. Michael Geoghegan</strong></p><p>Left HSBC as a result of Green's decision to enter government. He was chief executive from 2006 and hoped to step up to chairman. But he lost out in an internal battle and quit after 37 years. In 2010, amid a row about bankers' bonuses, Geoghegan diverted his £4m bonus to charity - one run by his wife Jania. He has since advised the Irish government on its "bad bank" Nama.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Sandy Flockhart </strong></p><p>Spent four decades at HSBC before retiring in July this year, just before the US Senate levelled its first accusations about the bank's operations in Mexico helping to facilitate drug barons. He had been head of the Mexican business from 2002 until 2006, then took on a job in Asia. He is now unwell.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. David Bagley</strong></p><p>The head of compliance dramatically resigned before the July Senate committee hearing although did not actually leave the bank until November. The register of individuals maintained by the Financial Services Authority now describes him as "inactive".</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hsbcholdings">HSBC</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking">Banking</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mexico">Mexico</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas">Americas</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lord-green">Lord Green</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jilltreanor">Jill Treanor</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Hansa Makwana, a slight 22-year-old, lives down a narrow lane in a mud and brick home with limited power and no sanitation. She is profoundly deaf and nearly blind and has been a "client'' of Sense International in India for a decade.</p><p>Once virtually incapable of communication and almost bed-bound, Hansa has spent thousands of hours over the last 10 years with her "educator'' Deepak, a local Sense International employee. Shecan now talk to those around her through a mixture of sign language and gestures, and can help with the gruelling routine domestic tasks of cleaning and cooking.</p><p>Crucially Hansa can be left alone, so her mother, Ramu, 45, can earn around 100 rupees (£1.20) per day working as a labourer. It may not be much but is an essential addition to the family's revenues.</p><p>"Now with my husband and son there are three wages coming in and, even if we have to borrow or go hungry from time to time, things are easier," Ramu said. "And Hansa is happy and more confident."</p><p>Sense International was founded in 1993 to meet "a desperate need to support and assist deafblind people in developing countries." The condition, serious visual and hearing impairment, afflicts more than 600,000 aworldwide, but receives little attention.</p><p>"In some of the world's poorest countries, deafblind children are excluded and live short, lonely lives. This is because of variety of reasons, including poverty, prejudice and lack of healthcare, education and support services. Sense International was set up to work ... with local organisations to provide expert support and services to deafblind people.</p><p>This sustainable support has always aimed to enable deafblind people and their families to be as independent as possible and live valued lives as human beings, while growing expertise locally," said James Thornberry, director of the London-based charity.</p><p>The condition is caused by diseases rife in much of the developing world today such as rubella, meningitis and encephalitis, genetic disorders as well as premature birth. The first project of Sense International was launched in 1994 in Latin America. The charity is active in Bangladesh, Kenya, Tanzania, Peru, Romania and Uganda.</p><p>Before the charity started work, there was only one specialist facility for deafblind children in the whole of India, in Mumbai, the commercial capital. There a mere 23 children received care.</p><p>"The services for the blind would not take those who could not hear, and services for the deaf rejected those who could not see. So the deaf-blind got nothing," said Akhil Paul, director of Sense International in India.</p><p>Fifteen years after launching in India, Sense International is now helping 43,000 deaf-blind children there through communication, mobility and vocational training as well as an advocacy programme.</p><p>One of the biggest difficulties has actually been finding the children in need. The government census has only recently begun including a question on disability, so Sense International here was forced to conduct their own surveys. The organisation now realise that despite the rapid expansion in recent years it is still only reaching less than a tenth of the hundreds of thousands of deafblind in India, many of whom live in remote rural areas.</p><p>Those numbers are set to rise. Many cases of deaf-blindness arise from Usher's Syndrome which causes early loss of hearing followed by a gradual deterioration of sight during teenage years. India's population is very young and tens of thousands of currently deaf children will therefore be suffering deaf-blindness in under a decade.</p><p>One is Meeraj, 15, a vivacious, happy schoolgirl who lives with her parents in the farming and quarrying town of Sayla in Gujarat. Thanks to the Sense International educators, Neeraj, who is profoundly deaf and has seriously impaired sight, now goes to a mainstream school three days of the week. Otherwise she attends a special class at a learning centre set up by a coalition of NGOs in the town.</p><p>"I love music and dancing," Meeraj told The Guardian. "I watch dancers and I copy their movements even if I can't hear the songs."</p><p>Meeraj knows that her sight has deteriorated in recent years but is unaware of the full extent of what awaits her. Doctors say total blindness is almost inevitable by the time she is 20.</p><p>Yet support and education can mean that at least the social isolation that was often a consequence of deafblindness can be mitigated. Rajesh Sheth lives not far from where Meeraj is studying, in the small town of Limbdi. Now 33, he has been assisted by Sense International for more than a decade. Garrulous, sociable and funny, he works with his parents making and selling fafda, a local snack made of deep fried spiced pastry.</p><p>"The biggest difference [the programme] made to me was that no one else could understand me until [my trainer] came. I was very happy and very relieved," Rajesh said. This week he will be following televised cricket, narrated by a shifting cast of intermediaries, as England play India in a crucial test match and will vote in local state elections. His mother has, as is traditional, started circulating the news among friends and relatives that she is now looking for a wife for him.</p><p>And tonight, as he does every weekend, Rajesh will sit with four friends, two of whom are deaf, at their favourite tea shop like tens of millions of other Indians to gossip, greet neighbours and drink hot milky chai as the sun goes down and another day in Limbdi ends.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/india">India</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jasonburke">Jason Burke</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Over the last four years of his presidency, restrictions on guns – in particular concealed weapons – have become more relaxed and gun sales soared.</p><p>There have been five major shooting sprees since he has been president, three of them this year. This one is different because the majority of the victims in the school in Newtown are young children, but the most recent opinion polls have shown overwhelming opposition to gun restrictions.</p><p>Obama, speaking in the White House press room, said the loss of innocent lives had broken hearts. "As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago – these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. </p><p>"And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."</p><p>Just minutes earlier, he broke down while delivering the statement. He said: "The majority of those who died today were children – beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old." Choking up, tears welling in his eyes, he paused for what seemed like an interminable time, though it was only 10 seconds.  </p><p>He went on: "They had their entire lives ahead of them – birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own." He then had to pause again.</p><p>Such emotion from the president is unusual, at odds with Obama's reputation for being overly cool. Twice during the statement, he wiped away tears as they began to form. The only other time he has been seen to cry in public was last month, when he spoke to campaign workers at the end of the White House election.</p><p>As a mark of respect for the dead, he ordered flags across the country to be flown at half-staff.</p><p>Minutes after Obama spoke there was strong response from the most high-profile figure in the country advocating gun control, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who called for an end to what he described as this madness.</p><p>"President Obama rightly sent his heartfelt condolences to the families in Newtown. But the country needs him to send a bill to Congress to fix this problem. Calling for 'meaningful action' is not enough. We need immediate action,"  Bloomberg said.</p><p>"We have heard all the rhetoric before. What we have not seen is leadership – not from the White House and not from Congress. That must end today."</p><p>New York governor Andrew Cuomo took a different view. In a statement paying tribute to the victims of "this senseless and horrific act of violence", Cuomo said: "While we don't have all the facts and our focus must be on the victims, this is yet another senseless and horrific act of violence involving guns. We as a society must unify and once and for all crack down on the guns that have cost the lives of far too many innocent Americans. Let this terrible tragedy finally be the wake-up call for aggressive action and I pledge my full support in that effort."</p><p>Early in his political career, Obama championed modest gun controls, but since his run for president he has largely avoided the issue.</p><p>Earlier on Friday, Obama's spokesman Jay Carney provoked a backlash from gun control activists when he said that the day of the Connecticut school shooting was not an appropriate one  for a discussion about gun laws. </p><p>Carney, asked at the daily press conference whether the shooting would raise gun control up the president's agenda, said there would be a day for discussion on the policy issue. "But I don't think today is that day," he said.</p><p>Gun control advocates flooded websites and Twitter, complaining that if this was not a day for discussion, when would be a better time.</p><p>Bloomberg, who is co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, rounded on Carney. "We heard after Columbine that it was too soon to talk about gun laws. We heard it after Virginia Tech. After Tucson and Aurora and Oak Creek. And now we are hearing it again. For every day we wait, 34 more people are murdered with guns. Today, many of them were five-year-olds," Bloomberg said. </p><p>His co-chair in the Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Boston mayor Thomas Menino, echoed him. "Now is the time for a national policy on guns that takes the loopholes out of the laws, the automatic weapons out of our neighborhoods and the tragedies like today out of our future," Menino said. </p><p>Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, joined in the calls for action. "Another day, another horrific shooting eating away at our collective peace of mind. This time at a school in Connecticut. We are better than this this. What matters is not what we do after the sensational tragedies. It's what we do between them – to make the voice of the American public heard," Gross said.</p><p>The National Rifle Association, which would almost certainly seek to block any legislation that would introduce significant gun restrictions, was lying low on Friday, as it normally does after shooting sprees. </p><p>An NRA public affairs spokeswoman, in response to a question about the Connecticut shooting, said: "Until the facts are thoroughly known, the NRA will not be making any comment.</p><p>In spite of Bloomberg's call for congressional action, the Republican House speaker, John Boehner, avoided any mention of action in his statement, confining himself to an expression of sympathy. </p><p>"The horror of this day seems so unbearable, but we will lock arms and unite as citizens, for that is how Americans rise above unspeakable evil," Boehner said.</p><p>There was a public outcry after the Columbine school shooting spree in 1999  and the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, the worst single incident in recent US history, claiming 33 lives. Calls for gun control were renewed last year when congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot in Arizona, and again this year, though to a much lesser extent, when 12 were killed in Aurora, Colorado.</p><p>Obama, two months after the Giffords shooting, promised "sound and effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place". The only measure to surface was more intensive background check but even this modest measure has so far failed to emerge from the Justice Department.</p><p>On Friday, Giffords' husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, called for immediate action. In a statement, he said: "As we mourn, we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right. This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook elementary school and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws – and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America. This can no longer wait."</p><p>Debate about gun laws was largely absent from this year's White House race, with Obama unwilling to provoke the gun lobby. The Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he saw no need to change any of the laws, even to restore a limited restrictions on automatic assault rifles. Obama agreed.</p><p>Both Romney and Obama had in the past supported limited gun controls but both dropped this in the face of polls showing widespread support for the right to carry guns. </p><p>A Gallup poll last year, only months after the Giffords shooting, found a record low in support for gun controls, just 26%. When Gallup first asked the question in 1959, there was 60% support. </p><p>During the campaign, when Carney was asked about Obama's position, he said the main focus of president, who four years earlier had supported a ban on assault-weapons, was to protect the second amendment, the constitutional protection for gun ownership. </p><p>Bills introduced into Congress in recent years to restrict guns have gone nowhere. In fact, laws around the country have been more lax, allowing people to carry concealed weapons and giving them more freedom about places they can take them into, including legislatures. In Florida, one million people have permits allowing them to carry concealed weapons.</p><p>Four Republican-dominated legislatures – Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee – are considering allowing employees to take guns to work.</p><p>Bloomberg News reported this month that gun manufacturers Smith & Wesson recorded record sales for its most recent quarter, up 48% from a year earlier.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control">US gun control</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime">US crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/michaelbloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans">Republicans</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Here are some of their&nbsp;stories</p><h2>Lanier Lovely, 18 </h2><p><strong>Displaced by </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/13/haiti-earthquake-disaster-hundreds-dead" title=""><strong>the earthquake in Haiti in 2010</strong></a><strong>, pictured with her son&nbsp;Lovinsky, in Port-au-Prince</strong></p><p>I was in the kitchen preparing a&nbsp;meal&nbsp;when the house started shaking. It collapsed and I was injured by rubble. I didn't realise I&nbsp;was bleeding. I kept on helping others who were trapped, but then&nbsp;the pain set in and I collapsed. I&nbsp;was crying because I couldn't find my mother. After the earthquake, we slept in the streets. I was in agony; there were dead bodies and people crying. Two days later, we went back to the house to get some&nbsp;clothes and then straight to a&nbsp;camp. Five days after that, I found my mother.</p><p>After six months in the camp, I&nbsp;was raped. A caseworker from the <a href="http://www.rescue.org/" title="">International Rescue Committee</a> took me to the hospital, but it was too late – I was pregnant.</p><p>My boy, Lovinsky, is 15 months old now. I love him very much, but&nbsp;sometimes I cry when I see other children who are living in a&nbsp;family with fathers who support&nbsp;them.</p><p>I never saw the rapist again. I left the camp to stay with my aunt and, once the baby was born, I moved in with my mother, who was staying in a tent. There's not enough security in the camp. I don't feel safe: the same thing could happen to me again. We need more security and lights at night, and those rapists should go to prison.</p><p>I hope I'll be able to leave the camp. My mother is going to rent a house and we might move tomorrow.</p><h2>Parvez Aslam Choudhry, 48<br /></h2><p><strong>From Lahore, Pakistan, pictured in&nbsp;Bangkok, Thailand</strong></p><p>I'm a human rights lawyer. I have three masters degrees, in History, Urdu and Political Science. In Pakistan, I worked on laws that discriminate against minorities, especially the blasphemy law, which&nbsp;is used mainly against Christians. In 2009 I was nominated for the human rights award by the European Union Bar Association.</p><p>Working on human rights issues made me a high-profile figure in Pakistan, which is why I received death threats. In 2006, my car was hit by Muslim extremists and a&nbsp;passenger was killed. I sustained many injuries and remained in hospital for weeks. In September 2010, mullahs declared outside the&nbsp;high court that my family and I&nbsp;were blasphemers working against&nbsp;Islam and were liable to be killed. I was sure I'd be assassinated at any moment, so we left Pakistan&nbsp;on 7 April 2011, with support from the EU.</p><p>Our main fear here in Thailand is arrest by the police, after our visas expire. We want to live like free human beings but, like all refugees, we're afraid. We feel stateless. When&nbsp;my wife and children ask about our future, I don't know what&nbsp;to tell them. I feel that later we&nbsp;can hope to start a new life in another country – whoever will take&nbsp;us. To live a life with a free mind is a necessity for every human&nbsp;being.</p><h2>Ebumbe Menga, 46 <br /></h2><p><strong>From the Fizi territories, Democratic Republic of the Congo, pictured in Bujumbura, Burundi</strong></p><p>I came here to escape the war between the government soldiers and the militias. As a Christian, I&nbsp;spoke out against the war, and this made me a target for the militias. A&nbsp;week after I fled to Burundi, I&nbsp;heard that my younger brother had been killed – I still don't know what happened to him. I came here with my wife, our three young children and a nephew. I heard a bit later that my house had been burned down. We were interviewed many times after we arrived and were given refugee status by the UN.</p><p>When you are a refugee it is very difficult to support your family. It isn't possible for UNHCR to provide for all the refugees in the city and in the camps. I help children with their after-school study and I can earn 5,000 Burundian francs (£2.20), which helps provide for my family. Another problem you face as a refugee is health care. You have to pay 50% of bills, which is impossible if you don't have any money or a job.</p><p>It would be impossible to return to Congo now. Life isn't good here either, and if it doesn't improve I will ask to be relocated to another country. I don't want to live in a camp because there are so few opportunities for someone as educated as me. That's why I&nbsp;stayed&nbsp;in the city.</p><h2>Tikaram Chapagai, 46<br /></h2><p><strong>From Bhutan, pictured with his wife Chandra on the roof of their apartment in New York</strong></p><p>Nepalese people in Bhutan were allowed to practise their customs freely and openly until 1989. Then we had to leave. We had no choice: they held a gun to our heads.</p><p>We left in 1992 with nothing more than the clothes we were wearing. We spent one night in India, before taking a bus to Nepal. For the next 16 years we lived in a refugee camp. We realised we were never going to be able to return to Bhutan. Our only option was to go to a third country.</p><p>We arrived at New York airport and staff from the International Rescue Committee were there to receive us. We went to the Bronx, where they had found us an apartment. It was exciting: we saw the subway, the tall buildings, the elevators. It was a&nbsp;totally different world. For four months they paid our rent, they took us to apply for our papers –&nbsp;social security, work permits, food stamps, medical benefits. We went to English classes, interviews and found a school for our son.</p><p>After three months, my wife got a&nbsp;job as a nurse and I got work as a&nbsp;cashier in one of LaGuardia airport's parking lots. We've been here for four years and we feel secure because we know how to get around, we have friends, and our son has done very well in school: he has received a scholarship to college. Of&nbsp;course we still struggle, but we are succeeding. We are making our life.</p><h2>Fawaz Rarhail Turkey, 59 </h2><p><strong>From Homs, Syria, pictured with his family in Al Mafraq, Jordan</strong></p><p>After the army forced their way into our homes, we became afraid for our&nbsp;children and decided to flee the country. There were snipers everywhere. Syrian soldiers killed four of my neighbours, and my brother was killed, along with eight people hiding in the bathroom of a&nbsp;nearby house.</p><p>First we moved to another part of Homs, but one day we were attacked and then we moved to Biyda. By the end of the week, we were in Hama.</p><p>There, I met a man who had a minibus and he agreed to take eight families to the border – 45 people in total. We traveled to Deraa, and then the Free Syrian Army helped us cross the border at night. We started walking at 8pm and arrived at 1am. There were 150 people, including the elderly and children, and we were afraid we would be targeted. The Jordanian army was waiting for&nbsp;us at the border. We were taken to a transit camp and treated well. After three days, we came here, to an abandoned house. We feel secure and can sleep safely, not like in Syria. I was interviewed yesterday by an international NGO and they asked if I wanted to be resettled in another country. I said no, I will return to my country when the regime falls. We have no hope to return until then.</p><h2>Daoud Ahmad Tahir Ali, 33<br /></h2><p><strong>From Al-Fashir, Sudan, now living in Birmingham, UK</strong></p><p>I'm from the Zakhawa tribe, and when the war began the government supported the Arabs. For us and other non-Arab tribes, this was a big problem. The government recruited militias to terrorise and kill. They destroyed our village.</p><p>I was living in Khartoum, studying law. I was spokesman for the Darfur Student Association, and was arrested many times. My parents and brother stayed in Al-Fashir, but many in my family fled to the camps.</p><p>In 2006, a peace agreement was signed, but it didn't last. By this time I had joined the Sudan Liberation Movement, and was leader of the student association, and was targeted by the government. So in December 2010 I&nbsp;decided to leave. When I got to Heathrow, they gave me a choice – go back to Sudan or Egypt or detention. I chose detention.After two weeks, I went through a&nbsp;screening process. They moved me&nbsp;to a hostel and then sent me to Scotland. Eventually, they put me in a hotel, where I lived for six months. With the refugee status documents, I was treated like a regular citizen.</p><p>I wanted to study, so I applied to Glasgow City College but didn't get in. I also applied to South Birmingham College and it accepted me. I have been in Birmingham nearly a year, and this July I was joined by my wife and 17-month-old son. I&nbsp;want to study here, then return to Darfur to&nbsp;help build a future there.</p><p>My current status allows me to stay for five years. After that, I'd need to renew and a year after that I&nbsp;would be able to apply for citizenship. But I hope we can change the Sudanese regime and I&nbsp;can return home before then.</p><h2>Ndagano Nakajosi, 50<br /></h2><p><strong>From Kitundu, Democratic Republic of Congo, pictured third from right with his family&nbsp;at a transit centre for newly&nbsp;arrived refugees in Bujumbura, Burundi</strong></p><p>We fled to escape the Mai Mai and the FDLR (Democratic Forces for the&nbsp;Liberation of Rwanda), who often attacked our village at night, stealing anything of value: money, radios, dishes, even mattresses. They would punish everyone left in&nbsp;the village, forcing the men to carry what they had stolen and systematically raping the women. My daughter was raped by eight men. She was 18 at the time, and now she has a disease because of the&nbsp;rape.</p><p>We decided to cross the Ruzizi river and bring her to the hospital here in Bujumbura. She seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;better, but her skin is not good&nbsp;and her behaviour has changed.</p><p>After they had raped my wife and my daughter, they made me carry the things they had stolen from us. Normally they kill you after, so you can't go back and tell your neighbours where they are, but I had a chance to escape. When I got home, I found my family crying.</p><p>That was when we decided to cross the Ruzizi. The life here is not good at all. We are in a government transit centre, but we are dying of hunger. I don't think we will ever go&nbsp;back to Congo, because I don't see how the Mai Mai could ever disappear from the forest.</p><p>My only hope is for God to take my children to a place where they can find something to eat. Here, they just go&nbsp;around begging for food. When I&nbsp;go to the camp, I&nbsp;won't&nbsp;be able to get a job. I&nbsp;will just stay there like a&nbsp;statue doing&nbsp;nothing.</p><h2>Qian Ming, 40<br /></h2><p><strong>From southern China, pictured in Bangkok, Thailand </strong></p><p>I believe in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong" title="">Falun Gong</a>, but in China the movement was banned on&nbsp;20 July 1999. Falun Gong includes traditional exercises like meditation and yoga, and we believe in Buddha and other gods. The Communist party controls the media, and after the ban it launched a campaign to slander Falun Gong. I wanted to tell people the truth about the movement, but the government punished me for what I did.</p><p>I was jailed for six years. First I&nbsp;served three years in a re-education camp, where they tried to brainwash&nbsp;me. We had to work 13&nbsp;and a half hours a day, seven days a week, and sometimes through the night. You were powerless – they had electric batons. For the second term, I was sent to&nbsp;prison. Here, the&nbsp;brainwashing was even worse. We were 16 people in a small cell. They ordered me to&nbsp;sit up straight on a small stool from 6am until 11pm. If I&nbsp;moved, they would beat me. Some of the prisoners lost their minds – they couldn't stand it, it was too cruel. I&nbsp;had some peaceful times there, because I decided to give up –&nbsp;but only on the outside. On the inside, I&nbsp;remained strong.</p><p>I was released in September 2010, but wasn't allowed to practise my religion, so I fled to Bangkok. I feel relaxed here. Most Thais won't report you unless you are very unfriendly towards them. The cost of living is low, but I'm not allowed to work. I get by with some support.&nbsp;It's relatively safe for Chinese people here because we look similar to Thais.</p><h2>Shafiq, 29</h2><p><strong>From Kabul, pictured in New&nbsp;York</strong></p><p>I was born in Kabul into a happy family. My mother was a doctor, my father worked for the government, my brothers studied. When the Taliban came to our country, my family left for Pakistan as refugees, but I stayed to continue my studies. In 2001, my family came back. After I finished school, I was a translator for a US company. Soon, I was receiving threats from local gangs for&nbsp;collaborating with the Americans. In 2003, my father, who worked in the state security ministry, was killed by the Taliban. My mother died of a&nbsp;heart defect six months later.</p><p>I was able to escape  to Russia under the pretext that I was going to study. I left in January 2006. I took a course in public administration and then entered the Rostov State Civil Engineering University. That summer, I visited Afghanistan, but when I arrived in Kabul, I found out that my elder brother had been killed as revenge for my father's work.</p><p>At this point I realised that I would never be able to see my town again. In 2008, I  went to Russia for the second time. I finished university and applied to the <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home.html" title="">International Organisation for Migration</a> in Moscow.</p><p>Now I've been in New York for one year and I feel like a part of it, like I'm living in my own country. I'm very happy here. The people are kind and helpful. I hope I can get a&nbsp;better job, that I'll be able to work in a good company and that I'll have&nbsp;a good life. You are free here.</p><h2>Pastor Bu Naing Ling, 58<br /></h2><p><strong>From Chin State, Burma. Pictured second from right with (from left) Rose Pam, 10, Sho Hlai Ling, 12, Theing Mana, and Shang Phu Lang Thang, 15, outside their apartment block in Kuala Lumpur,&nbsp;Malaysia </strong></p><p>In southern Chin state, Buddhism is spread by the government, who offer&nbsp;inducements to people to convert (over 90% of Chins are Christian). In 1981, I became a&nbsp;Christian and began preaching in the villages, but they took away my travel documents. I&nbsp;was banned from preaching, threatened and had to stop work on the church I had been building.</p><p>I had to report to the authorities every night and pay them bribes. I&nbsp;endured this for many years, until I&nbsp;decided to leave in August 2009. With the help of traffickers, we travelled by foot and by car, often by night and with little or no food. It took us two weeks to get to Kuala Lumpur. I borrowed money and sold all my wife's jewellery to pay the traffickers, but I still owe them money for the journey. My wife is working here and I'm preaching. When we have some money, we send it to the traffickers. They keep calling and are charging interest.</p><p>In 2010, I was arrested in a raid on our building. I spent nearly five months in prison. I have a UNHCR card now, but I still find it hard here. I wish we could be resettled because my kids can't go to school here.</p><h2>Beatrice, 27<br /></h2><p><strong>From South Kivu, Congo, pictured in Bangkok, Thailand</strong></p><p>I used to work for a human rights association. In March 2010, rebels came to our village, stole a lot and raped many women. When they left, the army came and did the same. I&nbsp;wrote a report on it, and soon after soldiers came to the office to threaten us. That night three soldiers came to my house. They beat me and said they were going to kill me.</p><p>In April 2010, six soldiers came, taped my mouth shut and tied me to the bed. All six raped me. I lost consciousness. Eventually I went to a health centre, but on the way home two men said they'd been told to kill me. They tried to drag me off, but I&nbsp;screamed and people helped.</p><p>Next day I fled to Burundi, and two&nbsp;weeks later I arrived in Bangkok. I applied for refugee status, but was refused. So I went to <a href="http://asylumaccess.org/AsylumAccess/" title="">Asylum Access</a>, and I'm waiting for a reply.</p><p>I knit some scarves to make a bit of money and my Pakistani neighbours give me some food. I want to get refugee status and to be relocated to a third country. I will only receive get support for six months, so I will have to leave my room soon and I&nbsp;don't know what to do. It hurts my head. I don't feel able to talk about the future; my present is misery.</p><p>• These stories and pictures are from <a href="http://www.hidden-lives.org.uk" title="">Hidden Lives: The Untold Story Of Urban Refugees</a>, a project funded by the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department in partnership with the International Rescue Committee UK.

As the college prepares to admit female students for the&nbsp;first time, Rory Carroll visits&nbsp;its 2,500-acre campus in the California desert</p><p>The same year that Lenin's Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace, another shortish, balding radical launched a&nbsp;social experiment of his own in a&nbsp;patch of desert in the Sierra Nevada foothills bordering California and Nevada. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Nunn" title="">Lucien Lucius Nunn</a>, a&nbsp;serious, industrious man, had made a fortune in mining, banking and power plants, including the electricity station at Niagara Falls, but making money was not his passion. While training engineers and managers to run his businesses, Nunn discovered his vocation was the education of young men. He set up courses that mixed labour with scholarships, and encouraged self-governance by the worker-students. In 1917 he set up a college at a ranch in Deep Springs, just north of Death Valley, to perpetuate his ideas.</p><p>Isolation would let the university quell the "uproar and strife of material things", he later wrote. "It teaches and believes that our educational institutions too often prepare their most brilliant students to be the ill-paid hirelings of the avaricious. Deep Springs does not disregard… commercialism or the spread of creature comforts, but, recognising the overloading of the ship on one side, aims to place the small weight of its influence where it will tend to develop men of fixed purpose and character, who will dedicate themselves to the higher cause of service."</p><p>Almost a century later, the valley remains a&nbsp;remote wilderness of desolate beauty, scrub, sand&nbsp;and rock stretching towards a horizon of ice-capped peaks. It appears uninterrupted by modernity save for a paved, empty road, the 168, which squeezes between gulleys and hugs undulating hills like a rollercoaster. Stop your car and the only sound is&nbsp;the wind.</p><p>"There are signs," said the email from the student communications committee. "We're the only inhabitation in the valley." A chipped wooden arch etched with the college's name straddles a dirt driveway, at the end of which sits a&nbsp;collection of single-storey buildings. They are modern but have a rough-hewn modesty. Smoke plumes from the chimneys. Nunn's dream endures – but is on the cusp of change. After half a century of anguished debate, the single-sex college is preparing to accept female students.</p><p>Deep Springs boasts 2,500 acres but has just 26 students, the number barely growing since the first intake of 20 in 1917. They mostly come from middle-class American families, with a smattering from other continents. They hear about it through word of mouth, lobby sceptical parents to let them apply, fend off intense competition (more than 10 applicants for each place) and swiftly establish a&nbsp;close community. "If I see a shadow at night, I&nbsp;know who it is," says Isaac Stafstrom, a quietly spoken student. "We get to know each other very&nbsp;well. This form of education is incredibly formative." He adds with a flash of pride: "We want to share this model with the outside world."</p><p>Deep Springs has survived and thrived in the middle of nowhere to claim its title as one of the world's most remarkable liberal arts colleges. Students spend two years studying an eclectic curriculum that includes ancient Greek, genetics, biology, music, philosophy, political science, mathematics, literature and international relations. There is no television, no mobile phone reception and limited internet access.</p><p>Tuition and board are free – each student receives a scholarship valued at about $50,000 – making this a cashless campus and one of a handful of free colleges in the US; rare, endangered islets amid a rising tide of fees, debts and drop-out rates. Endowments pay for half the $1.6m annual running cost; the rest comes through fundraising.</p><p>Students, however, must spend at least 20 hours a week doing "labour" to keep the college-cum-ranch ticking over: cooking, cleaning, gardening, milking cows, saddling horses, herding cattle, moving hay, butchering chickens, wiring cables, sorting library books, fixing vehicles. On top of this, they must administer college affairs: debating and voting on things such as amending the curriculum, hiring staff, sifting applications for next year's intake, deterring coyotes (shoot them, according to a&nbsp;recent decision), expanding or restricting internet access, vetting visitor requests. (The students mulled the Guardian's request for six months before saying yes.)</p><p>"It's experiential education," says Jill Lawrence, 62, the college's director of operations, a Chester native who in a former life taught in British schools. "Self-governance means the students have a lot of say. They take it seriously because they live with the consequences." The resultant well-ordered campus is the antithesis of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/childrens-books-site/2012/jan/24/review-lord-flies-william-golding" title="">Lord Of The Flies</a>. "They do an excellent job."</p><p>Deep Springs does not bestow degrees. Graduates earn academic credits that tend to knock a year off subsequent university courses back in the outside world. Most graduates end up at Ivy League schools.</p><p>In accordance with the founder's instruction, students, typically aged 18 to 21, are all male, a&nbsp;tradition that has fuelled a myth of rugged cowboy scholars who break in horses after a&nbsp;morning contemplating Plato. But last year the board and trustees, after previous failed attempts, voted to allow females in. The students approved the decision in a majority vote. Some conservative trustees have resisted, prompting an ongoing court case, but faculty and students are reviewing female applicants' submissions in expectation that the college will be co-ed for the next intake in July 2013. The goal is gender parity within three years.</p><p>The prospect prompts excitement, pride and twinges of trepidation. "With any change, there is&nbsp;a sense of loss," says Stafstrom, a second-year student and accomplished horseman. Daniel Leibovitz, 20, the student president, cheers the prospect: "Something will be lost," he concedes, "but it will be minuscule in comparison to what will be gained. I do believe it will be a better place."</p><p>Parents worried about daughters vanishing into the maw of a sex-starved redneck frat house can rest easy. Students revel in an unshaved and, in some cases, unwashed masculinity, and everyone prefers herding to washing up, but nobody comes here for the sex or booze, not least because the latter is banned. The hunger is for knowledge, direction and intensity of experience; a desire, as&nbsp;many self-consciously put it, "to be present".</p><p>Jacob Greenberg, 20, quit a school in New York to come. "Social life consisted of binge-drinking so you could hook up with other people, and that was depressing. I wanted to be free of the normative expectations of identity." Other students speak of wanting to "challenge my values" and "blur traditional gender roles". One&nbsp;previous intake studied knitting.</p><p>Students recently approved an experimental weekend of silence, but they are not monkish. They have laptops and iPods, blast rock music in their dorms, do stunts such as naked hikes; but the isolation and enforced companionship, living side by side for 24 hours a day, strips away posturing. "The thing about testosterone is, it's a&nbsp;mask," says David Neidorf, the long-serving college president. "In a small community, the mask doesn't last; you can't fake it for long." Some students are straight, others gay, others unsure. "People fall in love, experience euphoria, despair; it's no different to other colleges," Neidorf says.</p><p>He speaks beside a crackling fire in the dining hall, where students and academic staff – half of them women – and four of their children tuck into pasta, kale, squash and banana cake. A portrait of Nunn, his expression stern, gazes down from the mantelpiece. Admitting female students arguably violates his precepts, but students nevertheless take pride in their founder and often cite his "grey book" of writings, including the exhortation: "Gentlemen, for what came ye into the wilderness? You came to prepare for a life of service, with the understanding that superior ability and generous purpose would be expected of you."</p><p>A campus T-shirt juxtaposes Lenin and Nunn, and makes a gleeful boast: "In 1917, two radical social utopias were born… only one survives." Neidorf nixes the idea of utopia: "We're not – we're a college." But it is notable that his students, in the era of Occupy, fee protests and marches against the 1%, do not rage against the system because here, to a large extent, they are the system.</p><p>The dining hall entrance, a small den with old armchairs, gives a taste of the students' passions: rubber boots, a fishing rod, a Penguin classic of René Descartes' <a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780140442069" title="">Discourse On Method</a>, an essay on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/flannery-o-connor" title="">Flannery O'Connor</a>, geological specimens, heaps of squash (a bumper harvest this year). The noticeboard mentions a meditation class and a film double bill: Samuel Beckett's <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0268536/" title="">Play</a> and Tennessee Williams' <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78196/streetcar.named.desire" title="">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>.</p><p>Philippe Chlenski, an affable 18-year-old with a&nbsp;wispy moustache, part of this July's intake, is given dispensation from an hour's labour to give me a campus tour. We visit the library (20,000 volumes), the ramshackle basement gym ("the house of pain"), the dark room, the reading room, the art studio, the carpentry and mechanic workshops, the stables with a dozen horses, the dairy (where students milk cows by hand and hug the beasts for warmth in freezing pre-dawn temperatures), the slaughter pen (where a&nbsp;bloodied sheep hide awaits tanning). We return to the main hall where a student from Hong Kong,&nbsp;Lucas Tse, 18, is singing Schubert's Lieder.</p><p>Chlenski is in charge of technology – meaning he must tangle with "Mordor", a closet of cables, to fix the internet when it breaks – but is no tech-worshipper. "I'm on the Spartan side of the debate over how much we should extend the internet. Extend it too much and it defeats the purpose of being here. Some want Wi-Fi everywhere, others want to throw computers out the window." Does the dispute cause resentment? He shakes his head. "You can't afford to be polemical and stubborn. You have to live here. There's nowhere to go."</p><p>Like most students, Chlenski heard of Deep Springs through word of mouth and lobbied his parents to let him apply. "It's a way of being in the world that a regular student isn't. Everything here is integrated." As if on cue, Stafstrom rides by in cowboy hat, boots and spurs with a plea for assistance. "Hey, do you know how to capture a&nbsp;ram?" Later that afternoon, another unexpected task: a dead cow requiring transport and disposal.</p><p>Brian Kahn, a visiting author and broadcaster, says the drudge of gaining competence in manual labour, be it cooking or welding, reveals the modern world's interdependence, something urban privilege can otherwise blur. "They get the connectedness of things," he says.</p><p>Leibovitz, the student president, develops this point while working on a broken engine transmission. With a&nbsp;bobble hat, oily latex gloves and a screwdriver, he hardly looks a scholar. "Thought is concretised by our experiences," he says. "Thought not only informs action, it compels it." Like many students, he is a&nbsp;fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="">Nietzsche</a>, but with a Deep Springs twist. "This is an exercise in humility," he says, tapping the transmission. "I&nbsp;suck&nbsp;at this. And that's valuable. Because pride is&nbsp;an&nbsp;impediment to a&nbsp;successful life of service."</p><p>That may sound grandiose, but it's sincere, and in a country where the military dominates the concept of service, Deep Springs reclaims it for civilian pursuits. Many graduates become academics and physicians.</p><p>The college is an enigma to the nearest town, Bishop, an hour's drive away. One rumour suggests it's a rehabilitation centre for homicidal adolescents, others suggest <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/108296/brokeback.mountain" title="">Brokeback Mountain</a>, or a cult. But to the dozen or so staff, it's a plum posting. "I'd never ridden horses before, and here I am herding cattle," marvels Ronald Mortensen, 67, a retired diplomat who teaches international relations. "It was on my bucket list." The students are a dream. "They complained to me that the reading list was too short. Imagine." Dick Dawson, 82, the music teacher, says they always exceed his expectations. "Simply put, they're amazing."</p><p>Is any of this replicable? Could Deep Springs become a model for colleges reeling from cutbacks and debt? Probably not. Deep Springs' formula requires isolation and diminutiveness. Keeping numbers low controls costs and makes free tuition viable. "We're pretty clear on the fact that we don't want to get bigger," Neidorf says.</p><p>So it stands as a one-off, a strange, beguiling institution in a desert valley where human purpose is debated amid coyotes and cows. The arrival of female students will change it, but perhaps not by much. Staff say the essays submitted by female applicants are indistinguishable from those of male applicants. The class of 2012 feels little burden about probably being the last all-male intake. "The absence of women? You know, I&nbsp;haven't noticed it that much," muses Tse, the&nbsp;Schubert singer. "You're just so busy here."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/california">California</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education">Higher education</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rorycarroll">Rory Carroll</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The same can't quite be said for this game, which follows a well-worn path and, despite its name, doesn't really do terribly much that's new. It's a spiritual successor to 1991's Super Mario World, using a similar map and borrowing some level design, while adding a new power-up, the Squirrel Suit, that lets you glide short distances. It saves most of its most original ideas for later in the game as you near Princess Peach's castle, now occupied by bad guy, Bowser. Its biggest innovation is five-player co-op, where the player with the gamepad can paint in extra platforms to help the other four get to the ends of levels more easily. Obviously that power can also be used to hinder, should they find themselves in that sort of mood. It's business as usual for Mario – now in high definition.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/games">Games</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/wii-u">Wii U</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/nintendo">Nintendo</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nickgillett">Nick Gillett</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Earlier downloadable content gave you a side story about vampires and the ability to build a pre-fabricated McMansion for your character, but somehow failed to capture the essence of the game. All that changes with Dragonborn, which lets you leave Skyrim for the island of Solstheim, an entirely separate land mass. It comes with new monsters and towns - best of all, though, is the impression of virgin territory: seeing a suspicious light in the distance or ruins on a hilltop and galloping off to see what's going on. It provides a hearty slab of exploration along with an interesting mystery to unravel.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/games">Games</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/skyrim">Skyrim</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/the-elder-scrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nickgillett">Nick Gillett</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Click here to view</a></p><p>It's as if the 70s, Germaine Greer and Fathers For Justice never happened. Asda's big Christmas advert takes us back to the cosy days when men were helpless, semi-functional morons and women were long-suffering domestic slaves. In this pre-Ocado idyll, it's Mum who runs the show - because she has to. Buying the tree, pumping up the blow-up bed, cooking the meal, humouring Granddad: there's nothing she can't do (except get a job). In this world, Dad – a giant, stubbly toddler – is incapable of doing anything bar pushing a massive tree (chosen by Mum) at a small car and raising a glass of wine for a family toast like a neutered Bing Crosby in a George shirt.</p><p>This is 2012, though, and Asda has consulted enough focus groups to know that, while sexism might help them secure their position as mid-range supermarket to the masses, the masses also like to think that they know a little something about "being cool". With that in mind, the advert employs sub-Tarantino jump cuts and features a rockin' version of Silent Night that sounds like the Cliff Richard Christmas album offcut in which Cliff decided to let loose and "have a little fun". It's the perfect style for our heroine, funky enough to mix it with the kids but not too threatening to complain about working 20-hour days in the unpaid domestic service industry. Still, all this mayhem will come to pass because, as the reassuringly classless voiceover reminds us at the end, Asda is behind the nation's mothers. Who needs help, respect or their own identity when they've got the assistance of a supermarket chain?</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/advertising">Advertising</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television">Television</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television">Television industry</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

And here's a late addition to the lineup; a guilty pleasure full of camp and vanity, complete with hissable villain and heaving cleavage.</p><p>It's the first in a hopeful new franchise for Tom Cruise, based on the bestsellers by Lee Child about a massive ex-military cop who travels the US with just a toothbrush, exacting crunchy justice on the fringe of the law. The books are insomniac heaven, pacey male fantasy about a life of righteous slugging and responsibility-free shagging.</p><p>But some fans had issues with Cruise's vital stats (Reacher is 6ft 5ins and almost 16 stone; Cruise is not). Child himself came to the rescue. "With another actor you might get 100% of the height but only 90% of Reacher. With Tom, you'll get 100% of Reacher with 90% of the height."</p><p>Trouble is, Reacher's stature is a fair percentage of his personality; a fact only patchily transferred to the film. When he duffs up five men in a car park, bystanders are duly awed, but no one remarks that it's especially impressive for a little fella.</p><p>Cruise does his best, swinging his arms, puffing his chest, clumping along with the physicality of a bigger man. But just as sucking in your cheeks can't make you thinner, nor does going through doors torso-first actually add inches.</p><p>The storyline has our hero teaming up with a hotshot lawyer, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), to track down a sniper behind a seemingly random attack. A scene early on that fairly murmurs with sexual tension has Helen sat on a motel room bed while Reacher explains the plot to her with his top off (he only has one set of clothes, and they've got all wet). Yet Cruise's pumped, hairless chest proves as distracting for us as for her. Partly it's the framing: when Pike is centre-screen, Cruise's left breast pokes into the bottom of the shot.</p><p>The adaptation is also hobbled by the need for so much of Reacher's lightning-quick calculations to be spoken aloud. A taciturn man becomes a gabbler, even a bit of a showoff. "You gotta pen?" asks one baddie, telling him the address where they're holding a hostage. "Don't need one," replies Reacher. Helen drops him off at a shop and asks if he needs a lift back. "There's a bus station three miles away; I can walk there in 24 minutes." In one glorious sequence he even pulls a Derren Brown-style stunt involving a vital clue written on a folded Post-It note before Pike has even had time to put in the call.Such wizardry is yet more impressive, of course, in relief to the bumbling crowds around him. Cops crash their cars, numbskulls knock each other out, murderers direct their best scowl towards the CCTV camera and detectives chat among themselves while their interviewee takes a call from the fugitive.</p><p>The film fizzes to life when someone else with a bit of charisma gets a look-in.</p><p>Luckily, there's two of them here: Robert Duvall, as a gummy gun store owner, and, as our mysterious uber-villain, the documentary maker Werner Herzog. Playing it so straight you sometimes wonder if he quite knows what he's doing, Herzog keeps his accent, adds a glass eye and explains why he's only got half a hand. "I spent my first winter as a prisoner in Siberia wearing a dead man's coat. I chewed these fingers off before the frostbite could turn to gangrene."</p><p>When Reacher has a foe as free-wheeling as that, the smackdown is worth watching. Yet even when it's just a one-man show, there's something compelling here. It is, in its way, a curious sort of auteurist cinema, in which a lone wolf (Cruise produces as well as stars) has taken an impeccably mainstream product and made it strange around him. Fans might have hankered after bona fide strappers like The Rock. I wouldn't have missed this for the world.</p><p class="rating">Rating: 3/5</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/tomcruise">Tom Cruise</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/wernerherzog">Werner Herzog</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/actionandadventure">Action and adventure</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/catherineshoard">Catherine Shoard</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Top of the pile is the seasonal offering from multiple award-winning promoters The Invisible Dot, now operating from a small but swanky room near Kings Cross in London and continuing to push the envelope when it comes to comedy presentation. Their Christmas show is hosted by much-fancied sketch trio Sheeps (above), whose imaginative writing and assured comic performances belie their extremely tender years. The rest of the bill's not to sniffed at, and features comic poet Tim Key and Alex Horne (with big band The Horne Section in tow), as well as sets from hardest working man in comedy Mark Watson and Casio keyboard-prodding genius David O'Doherty.</p><p><em>Union Chapel, N1, Mon</em></p><h2><a href="http://thebloomsbury.com" title="">Nine Lessons And Carols For Godless People, London</a></h2><p>It's entirely missing the point of his most dearly cherished principles to say thank God for Robin Ince, but audiences certainly owe him a debt of gratitude for these Christmas shows. Now in their fifth year, the Nine Lessons are back to provide atheists, rationalists and – just as importantly – lovers of great entertainment with the perfect festive fix. As usual, Ince has assembled a series of lineups that mix class-leading comedy with offbeat music and accessible pop science. The laughs come from big names such as Thick Of It star Chris Addison (pictured) and regular contributor Stewart Lee, plus newer talents like rocket-fixated stand-up Helen Keen and sketch duo Luke & Nadia. Look out, too, for cameos from the possessor of the throatiest laugh in showbiz, Barry Cryer, as well as comic book legend Alan Moore.</p><p><em>Bloomsbury Theatre, WC1, Sat to Thu; & 22-23 Dec</em></p><h2>Jerry Sadowitz: Return Of The Bawbag, London</h2><p>In this season of goodwill, who could be more appropriate to see than Jerry Sadowitz, a performer whose every thought seems governed by massive hostility towards the rest of the world and everyone in it? Whereas modern say-the-unsayable comics such as Frankie Boyle have a mischievous twinkle that accompanies even their most base utterances, Sadowitz's bile-spattered comedy comes from a much darker place: he's a true misanthrope who seems genuinely alienated from the rest of society, rather than someone putting on an act. While this makes him sound more like a case for psychoanalysis than an entertainer, it's impossible to gainsay the phenomenal results he creates onstage. Many of the gags will scandalise even the most open-minded audience but for those who can cope with the onslaught it's a cathartic and hilarious experience.</p><p><em>Leicester Square Theatre, WC2, Thu & Fri, to 5 Jan</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/comedy">Comedy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/jerry-sadowitz">Jerry Sadowitz</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-kettle">James Kettle</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Aunt Maria is aghast. "Who cares which girl you marry," she snaps, bustle crackling with indignation. "You are an unattached marquess. It is your duty to marry again and get an heir!"</p><p>At this point, when faced with such period-specific umbrage, it is customary for one to insert one's monocle and refer to one's dog-eared copy of The Crashingly Inevitable Downton Abbey Comparisons<em> </em>Companion. And on first appearances <strong>The Making Of A Lady </strong>(<em>Sunday, 8pm, ITV1</em>) – a feature-length adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Making Of A Marchioness – seems to invite such comparisons with open arms. There are costumes. There is a stately country house. There is a grapefruit-faced housekeeper and a butler who looks like the wrong answer in a game of Guess Who? There are overly accented scullery maids a-titterin' an' a-gossipin' under marshmallowy bonnets. There is a string-heavy score that becomes aroused at times of narrative stress and positively tumescent at the sight of a poorly secured cravat. There is sexual repression and an over-buffed blunderbuss. But this is where the similarities end. The Making Of A Lady is an altogether odder kettle of posh.</p><p>It starts simply enough. Wispy, genteel, kind-hearted secretary Emily (a lovely performance from Lydia Wilson) reluctantly agrees to marry landed tit Walderhurst (Linus Roache) for the purposes of social improvement. Life in the marital mansion passes in a series of stifled yawns and half-hearted gropes by gaslight. There are dinner table longuers and lingering shots of Emily looking pained at a writing desk. It's all unervingly reminiscent of one of those Catherine Cookson miniseries in which some rustic mimsy in a Great Uncle Bulgaria shawl blithers on about "duty" and "a woman's place" before banging a blacksmith on a tor. It's not exactly a bouncing jalopy of woo-hoo.</p><p>But then Walderhurst's shifty cousin arrives and Things start to Happen. There is malaria and an imperilled dray horse. Joanna Lumley glides on, realises she's too likable to convince as a bitchy matriarch, and glides off again. The suspense mounts. There is an abandoned cottage and the line "There's going to be a storm", followed by a storm. And there is, unfortunately, an elderly Indian servant whose every appearance is accompanied by a "mysterious" Indian flute motif, presumably to ensure we don't suddenly mistake her for a strippergram or member of Union J. Cue an uncomfortable "beware the exotics" subtext which, when combined with references to unpleasant rumblings in the colonies, threatens to turn the whole thing into It Ain't Half Hot Ma'am. But never mind. The past is a foreign country; they do things racistly there. As the big hand creeps towards denouement o'clock, you start to realise that not only is what you think couldn't possibly happen because it's too silly happening, it is happening with a face so straight it's almost heroic. All of which makes for an unapologetically old-fashioned, beautifully shot, thunderingly unsubtle melodrama that falls somewhere between diverting twaddle and humourless hoopla. Etiquette decrees that we call it Frownton Abbey before apologising profusely and leaving in the nearest barouche.</p><p>Earthier larks abound in <strong>Slade Night</strong> (<em>Friday, from 9pm, BBC4</em>). Comprising 1999 documentary It's Slade!, archive-clip treasure trove Slade At The BBC, and a rare showing of magnificently bleak "it's a shit business" music industry film Slade In Flame, it offers a timely celebration of the band whose yearly, bellowed exhortations to "LOOK TO THE FUTURE NOW IT'S ONLY JUST BEGUN" are almost entirely responsible for ensuring that Britain's idea of the perfect Christmas is sitting in a front room in Wolverhampton in 1973, watching Noddy Holder gurn at a turkey. Ding dong merrily indeed.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sarahdempster">Sarah Dempster</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was creased and scratched, but he knew I would remember the moment it captured as strongly as he did. So he had it cleaned and enlarged and gave it to me for my&nbsp;birthday.</p><p>Jonny was three and I was six when this picture was taken in May 1963; he and I did everything together, and I adored him. I'm sure we had been plonked into our parents' bed to keep us out of mischief, but on this particular evening we were in for a treat. Mum brought up two bowls of tinned pears on a heavy wooden tray. What could be more exciting than that?</p><p>I remember the grainy texture and slightly acidic sweet sliminess of the pears as I chased them round my bowl using my fingers to push the last pieces on to my spoon.</p><p>Dad took this photograph with his snazzy new camera – I'm in bossy big sister mode with my arm behind Jonny's back encouraging him to sit up and smile sensibly like me. It never worked because he hated having his picture taken and he always pulled faces and larked about – he'd deny it but he still does it!</p><p>The cosy winceyette nightwear and woolly cardigans give away the chilly Yorkshire weather even in May, but we were used to being cold. In winter, Mum would warm our fancy-knit Chilprufe vests on the five-bar fire before we got up in the morning, sometimes only just rescuing them before they burst into flames. We wore them anyway, the smell of singed wool following us down to breakfast.</p><p>Mum died in 1969 and this picture reminds Jonny and me of our lovely, safe, innocent early childhood. If someone set my house on fire with a burned vest today, I'd have to grab this photograph. It's one of my most precious possessions. <em>Penny&nbsp;Little</em></p><h2><strong>Playlist: There is nothing like our dame </strong></h2><p><strong>In the Chapel in the Moonlight by Vera&nbsp;Lynn </strong></p><p><em>"How I love to hear the organ / In the chapel in the moonlight"</em></p><p></p><p>In the prewar years, my brother – who was four years older than me – and I agreed to spend two shillings (now, 10p) on our Christmas presents for each other. Mine for him was easy – anything to do with sport would be all right. He had a weekly football magazine and each Saturday he would diligently move the tags for the teams up and down according to how they had scored.</p><p>We had just acquired a wind-up gramophone and Woolworths had, much to my delight, opened a new shop in Chepstow, where we lived.</p><p>I began to visit their collection of Crown records and with the thought of the princely sum being spent on me, it meant I could have four records costing sixpence each. But which to have?</p><p>Each time I went in, I changed my mind. Should it be Cheek to Cheek, Red Sails in the Sunset, I'm in the Mood for Love, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3swvOMYFQg4" title="">Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire</a> or Top Hat? Several were recorded by Charlie Kunz conducting, "with vocal refrain by Vera Lynn".</p><p>I was a keen listener to the BBC on our Pye wireless set. Dance band music was very popular and regularly broadcast from the leading hotels. I liked the clear, strong voice of Vera Lynn, and she became one of my four Christmas record choices, singing Chapel in the Moonlight.</p><p>I heard it again recently in a tribute programme to the star, who is still with us, and a wave of nostalgia went through me. I had the pleasure of seeing her in a variety show at the Wolverhampton Hippodrome in 1944 before she went to Burma.</p><p>I caught up with Charlie Kunz in 1953 when he was a patient at the Chepstow community hospital, where he was recovering from surgery to improve problems with his hands. He&nbsp;was often practising on a dummy piano but was willing to open a garden fete for us. He was a real gent, as much as our Vera has become a treasured dame. <em>Tudor Williams</em></p><h2><strong>We love to eat: Swedish&nbsp;muesli</strong></h2><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p><em>2 big cooking apples, preferably bramley</em></p><p><em>Porridge oats, approx 1 cup per apple</em></p><p><em>1 tbsp demerara sugar per apple</em></p><p><em>Raisins, chopped apricots or similar</em></p><p><em>Juice and zest of a lemon</em></p><p><em>Milk or cream</em></p><p><em>2 tbsp melted marmalade</em></p><p><em>Generous grating of nutmeg</em></p><p><em>Fresh berries</em></p><p></p><p>Grate the apples into a big bowl – we leave the skin on, but peeled if you like, and without the cores. Grate lemon peel into apple and squeeze lemon juice over it to prevent it going brown. Stir well. Add the oats but use your judgment. It doesn't want to be too stodgy. Add the sugar, melted marmalade, nutmeg, dried/fresh fruit. Note that nuts and seeds do not really work. Finally, stir in enough milk or cream to give it a nice dropping consistency. Serve with a sprinkle of brown sugar and a little extra milk. This makes a wonderful pudding.</p><p>I<em> </em>am 78 and this recipe has been tremendously popular with me and my family since a Swedish au pair taught my mother how to make it in the 1930s.</p><p>Recently, a long-lost friend came back into my life, who I hadn't seen or heard of since we were teenagers. Lloyd had been my older brother David's best friend. He is now 80, and a retired canon. Having found each other again, Lloyd and his wife visited me and one night I made us Swedish muesli. To my astonishment and delight, he remembered it from our youth. If my brother brought him home after school, Mother would say, "Right, if Lloyd is staying for tea, you two boys can make the muesli while I cut bread and butter." By then there were 10 of us – Mum and Dad, seven of us children, plus Granny Proctor.</p><p>Wasn't that amazing, that he should remember after all those years?</p><p>In the 1930s, our father was working in Sweden for much of the year, and Mother at home in Devon nearly always had a Swedish au pair girl to help with the children. Never mind the Swiss variety, we were brought up on Swedish muesli<em>. </em></p><p>If not all eaten at once, Swedish muesli is quite happy for a day or two in a covered bowl in the fridge – some of us think it improves with keeping. <em>Joy Peach, nee Proctor</em></p><h2>We'd love to hear your stories<br /></h2><p>We will pay £25 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We love to eat we publish.

Sure it's a great movie but, just as Jimmy Stewart is invited to imagine the world without him, perhaps we can imagine festive moviegoing without Frank Capra's well-worn perennial? Here's a glimpse of that alternative reality.</p><p>In cinemas across the UK, familiar staples of Christmas programming are sprinkled around the schedules, with old chestnuts (such as White Christmas and Miracle On 34th Street) and newer classics (Gremlins and The Muppet Christmas Carol). But it's Bruce Willis's incidentally Christmassy <strong>Die Hard</strong> that's emerging as the new seasonal favourite. London's Prince Charles (WC2) goes the extra distance with a back-to-back Die Hard trilogy tomorrow, but warns they're not playing part 4 as they "don't consider it to be a proper Die Hard film".</p><p>For exceptions to the norm, many Picturehouse cinemas are screening the Bolshoi Ballet's<strong> The Nutcracker </strong>live all week alongside the usual movie suspects, with added fundraising for children's charity Barnardo's. There's also the BFI Southbank's (SE1) vintage festive compilations in its <strong>Ghosts Of Christmas Specials Past</strong> season. This Wednesday's <strong>Madcap Christmas</strong> features the Goons' TV puppet show and Eric Idle's Rutland Weekend Television, and there's an animation compilation on Thursday including Aardman's Hooves Of Fire and Posy Simmonds's Famous Fred.</p><p>Or, if it's something special you're after, the Barbican has special screenings of <strong>The Snowman</strong> and <strong>Peter And The Wolf</strong> double bill and <strong>The Wizard Of Oz</strong>, both supplemented by a full orchestra (EC2, 22 & 23 Dec). For something more family unfriendly, there's the <strong>Guilty Pleasures Christmas Cinema Party</strong> tonight at the Troxy (E1) with a screening of Billy Bob Thornton's disgustingly wrong comedy Bad Santa, cabaret acts, a "bad" Santa's grotto and, of course, killer tunes, to which you can humiliate yourself on the dancefloor.</p><p>Or, if you're just after an alternative venue, the Old Vic Tunnels is still decked out as an indoor Alpine forest for its <a href="http://everymancinema.com/oldvictunnels" title=""><strong>Enchanted Pictures</strong></a> season (SE1, Sat to 23 Dec). This weekend you've got Ghostbusters, The Goonies and the original Willy Wonka on offer. Also, <strong>Experience Cinema</strong> have taken over Hackney Downs Studios (E8, Sat to 23 Dec), where they've got an 80s-heavy bill including Bill Murray's Scrooged, National Lampoon's Vacation and even Dudley Moore's Santa Claus The Movie. Experience are also holding special screenings at Hackney's atmospheric Round Chapel today: Will Ferrell's Elf followed by, er, It's A Wonderful Life.

The Beeb has been mining a rich vein, introducing us to hitherto unheard-of shows such as Wallander, The Bridge, Borgen, Sebastian Bergman and, of course, Denmark's The Killing, which is the clear leader of the pack.</p><p>On paper The Killing doesn't sound too different from any other cop show: Sarah Lund is a tenacious detective who just cannot let any case go unsolved; she's consumed by seeing justice done, ruining her personal life in the process. It's the level of commitment that sells it, particularly from Sofie Gräbøl as Lund, presenting extremely resourceful yet deeply flawed character; her police work is closer to a mental illness than a job. Another plus is the relentless seriousness: everyone is either sad or angry, or both; humour only surfaces when someone has had enough of Lund's continual habit of walking away or hanging up her phone mid-conversation because a nagging question or fact has taken her concentration elsewhere. We also benefit from the unfamiliarity of the performers: we don't know any of these faces so they carry no baggage. Anyone could be guilty (and probably is; the show is about how crime taints anyone even peripherally involved) as these grim but fascinating crimes are doggedly explored one day at a time.</p><p><em>Blu-ray & DVD, Arrow</em></p><h2><strong>Luck </strong></h2><p>Sprawling racetrack-centred crime drama starring Dustin Hoffman, produced my Michael Mann, written by Deadwood's David Milch.</p><p><em>Blu-ray & DVD, HBO</em></p><h2><strong>Les Misérables</strong></h2><p>Two lavish non-singing, non-dancing Hollywood adaptations (1935/1952) of the Victor Hugo novel.</p><p><em>DVD, Fox</em></p><h2><strong>The Libertines: There Are No Innocent Bystanders</strong></h2><p>Expanded edition of the doc about the band's 2010 reunion.</p><p><em>DVD, Pulse</em></p><h2><strong>Star Trek: The Next Generation – Season 2</strong></h2><p>More stunningly restored episodes from the phenomenally successful 'Trek franchise.</p><p><em>Blu-ray, Paramount</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/dvdreviews">DVD and video reviews</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/phelimoneill">Phelim O'Neill</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I'm definitely making an effort to watch that. It always helps when these things are on Sunday night, rather than Friday! It gives you a pep up. I thought <strong>Parade's End</strong> was amazing. I haven't read the book, but I have downloaded it. That's a really awful thing to say, isn't it? The worst modern thing you could possibly say!</p><h2><strong>Annoying TV trend?</strong></h2><p>I'm not a big one for structured reality. I was trying to explain it to someone the other day and it ended up sounding ridiculously philosophical and meta. You end up having these absurd conversations about something that's not very good. It feels like it's in everything now. I worry that that's to do with money, because if you have something that's semi-improvised by people who are not actors or performers, that means you don't have to pay anyone. Then if they do want to make something with actors and writers, suddenly the budget for that seems massive.</p><h2><strong>Bring back ...</strong></h2><p>I would love to see our current government receive the <strong>Spitting Image</strong> treatment and see who could survive it. Some of the things they're doing are so awful, and it's being PRed at us in quite an astonishing way. Spitting Image could destroy some of these people in a fortnight.</p><h2><strong>Come Dine With Me lineup?</strong></h2><p>I love modern American fiction so I think I'd like a selection of American authors. I'd like John Updike, Phillip Roth, Saul Bellow, and Dorothy Parker. They can all be quite filthy. I think that, if a bit of drinking was done, it wouldn't have to be too highbrow.</p><h2><strong>Mastermind specialist subject?</strong></h2><p>I was obsessed with Michael Jackson to the point of mania between the ages of 10 and 14, and I used to write extremely long multiple choice quizzes about Michael Jackson for my family to complete! Things like, "How many zips were on the jacket he wore for the Beat It video?" I'm sure I've still got my paperwork somewhere!</p><p><strong><em>Katy Brand's Little Cracker, Wednesday, 9.30pm, Sky1 HD</em></strong></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/gwilym-mumford">Gwilym Mumford</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

House-World or something? Season two of the award-winning drama traded suspense for shouty action, and didn't always benefit from the shift. That said, there have still been highlights, most notably a teary interrogation scene between Claire Danes and Damien Lewis, which reminded us of why the former proved such an Emmy magnet back in September. 4OD has the most recent episodes of Homeland to view in advance of next week's season finale; the whole series can be purchased on Blinkbox.</p><p><a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/homeland/4od" title=""><em>4OD</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.blinkbox.com/TV/Series/924/Homeland" title=""><em>Blinkbox</em></a></p><h2>Video: Twisted Showcase</h2><p>This low-budget comic horror anthology, which we included in our list of best web shows earlier this year, recently returned for a second series, with the latest episode, Press Play, attempting a homage of sorts to Haneke's Hidden.

Whether any of New Year's Eve is actually entertaining is difficult to deduce, but Turkington's commitment to the act is worth applauding.</p><p><a href="http://feralaudio.com/show/new-years-eve-with-neil-hamburger/" title=""><em>Online</em></a></p><h2>TV: Only Connect</h2><p>Now into its sixth series, Only Connect continues to provide a pleasingly brainy alternative to the lobotomised quiz show fare on terrestrial TV. It's also good for playing along with at home, provided you're ready to recognise your own intellectual limitations on a dispiritingly frequent basis.

Their transformation from indie duckling to dance-rock swan has proved to be a masterstroke. Remixers across the entire spectrum of cool from Robbie Williams to LCD Soundsystem and DJ Shadow, the band and their self-explanatory turntablist affiliate 2manydjs (made up of David and Stephen), who also perform at these festive knees-ups are satisfying to open-minded rockers and seasoned dance music fans alike, their music, in the right light, sounding like the missing link between late 20th-century punk-funk and Queens Of The Stone Age.</p><p><strong><em>O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Fri and 22 Dec</em></strong></p><p><em>John Robinson</em></p><h2>Alasdair Roberts, Glasgow</h2><p>In a world where people could be confused into thinking that a folk musician is a fund manager's son carrying an accordion, Alasdair Roberts provides a refreshing resetting of perspective. A man musically at ease in all sorts of company – solo; playing experimental rock; singing in Gaelic, as he has this year with Mairi Morrison – Roberts has already had a nearly 20-year career, marked by prolific, idiosyncratic releases and widespread collaboration. In this respect he's like a Scottish version of Will Oldham: someone who was once a hero, but has now become an associate and collaborator. A mixture of traditional songs and his own, a Roberts set runs the gamut of ancient and modern.</p><p><strong><em>Glad Café, Wed</em></strong></p><p><em>JR</em></p><h2>The xx, John Talabot, London</h2><p>For all their avowed influences from the world of electronic music and R&B, the minimal sound of the xx remains a pretty indie one, isolation in one form or another remaining the backbone of the band's sound. Still, as if to prove that everyone needs to get out of the house now and then, an area in which the band's music has flowered particularly is in the remix. As rebooted by Barcelona's top disco spinner John Talabot, the likes of their song Shelter take on an agreeably Balearic flavour. For the London date here, Talabot will bring some of the upbeat flavours of his Fin album of this year in support. Meanwhile, the Putney band will create a rather heavier atmosphere on their own. Their 2012 album Coexist might have seen the xx get bigger, but it's certainly not found them getting any brighter. Merry xxmas!</p><p><strong><em>O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Sun; Brighton Centre, Thu</em></strong></p><p><em>JR</em></p><h2>Konk Pack, On tour</h2><p>The German-British improv trio Konk Pack have collected the kind of international accolades since their 1997 formation that make a six-year UK absence hard to fathom. They came together in Budapest in 1997, when German analogue synth original Thomas Lehn, Henry Cow man Tim Hodgkinson, and British free improv percussionist Roger Turner discovered how much they had in common. The three were soon recording for the Cologne-based GROB label, before playing a seminal concert with the late guitarist Derek Bailey and in recent years have been pursuing their own distinctive brand of fast moving, highly detailed improv.</p><p><strong><em>St Margaret's Church, Manchester, Sat; Cafe OTO, E8, Tue; Cowley Club, Brighton, Wed; Jacob's Ladder Inn, Dartington, nr Falmouth, Fri</em></strong></p><p><em>John Fordham</em></p><h2>Alan Barnes, On tour</h2><p>Some music lovers might have come across Alan Barnes recently on The Jazz Age, Bryan Ferry's traditional jazz makeover of Roxy Music hits, but he started out inspired by the traditionalist Acker Bilk. His work travels way beyond that however and as a saxophonist he swerves between 1930s swing and Charlie Parker's double time, in territory between Sonny Rollins and free jazz. The Berkhamsted and Wilmslow gigs will feature pianist Dave Newton, with the pair playing material from their recent album Inside Out.</p><p><strong><em>Civic Centre, Berkhamsted, Sat; Wilmslow Conservative Club, Mon; St James Social Club, Swansea, Wed; Progress Theatre, Reading, Fri</em></strong></p><p><em>JF</em></p><h2>Zurich Opera Orchestra, London</h2><p>Vying with Verdi for top anniversary honours in 2013, there will be no shortage of opportunities to celebrate the bicentenary of Wagner's birth around the UK. But one chance comes early, as the Zurich Opera Orchestra brings the cast of its new production of Die Fliegende Holländer to the Royal Festival Hall for a one-off concert performance, with Alain Altinoglu conducting the Zurich Philharmonia. First performed in 1843, Wagner's operatic treatment of the legend, which is recognised as his first masterpiece, was really the work in which he first revealed his potential as a composer for the stage. All the essential ingredients of his later mastery of music drama are there in embryonic form, though still couched in the traditional forms of 19th-century opera. In this performance Bryn Terfel sings the title role, with Anja Kampe as Senta and Matti Salminen as Daland.</p><p><strong><em>Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Sat</em></strong></p><p><em>Andrew Clements</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock">Pop and rock</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewclements">Andrew Clements</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnfordham">John Fordham</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnrobinson">John Robinson</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In repeating the trick, Frank Ocean sounds like the saddest travel agent imaginable. "Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost", he laments, so distrught he mixes cities up with countries A tale of falling in love with a drugs mule it skips along overa loose-limbed beat, sparkly riff, and sighing strings.</p><h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNpBahr49mA" title=""><strong>Ellie Goulding</strong></a><strong> </strong><br /><strong>Figure 8 (Polydor)</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Just as Ellie Goulding splits with noted hair criminal and part-time aural activist Skrillex, she goes and releases her most "Skrillex" single yet. After a fairly tuneless intro that features a lot of cooing and general "atmospherics", there's one of those almighty drops that makes your bowels shift slightly before the chorus detonates, splintering the song into tiny fragments. It's a bold choice for a single completely undermined by a video that looks like a poorly realised GCSE media studies version of a perfume advert.</p><h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2ioQw6Oebo" title=""><strong>Girls Aloud</strong></a><strong> </strong><br /><strong>Beautiful 'Cause You Love Me (Fascination)</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Like most fans of Girls Aloud, I assumed the band's low point had been reached in 2007 when they teamed up with Sugababes v3 for a depressingly limp reworking of Walk This Way, which at the time was their only single not to have been produced by Xenomania. Well, I was wrong, because at least that was for charity. Beautiful 'Cause You Love Me – a ballad, never their strongest suit – also misses Xenomania's midas touch and features lyrics so sappy and toe-curlingly condescending Jessie J would have turned it down for being "a bit much".</p><h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8wR3KYAya4" title=""><strong>JLS</strong></a><strong> </strong><br /><strong>Hold Me Down (RCA)</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>It's a shame, but just as JLS seem to be making the sort of music they might actually listen to at home – their new album's basically a reapproximation of Justin Timberlake's Justified – everyone seems to be past caring. Produced by Rodney Jerkins, the man behind the Spice Girls' last and least-loved album Forever, Hold Me Down is a sweetly sung ode to not giving up even though everyone wants you to. There's something tragically poetic about it all, really.</p><h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFCWdrnZIIs" title=""><strong>Robbie Williams</strong></a><strong> </strong><br /><strong>Different (Island)</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>As much as Robbie Williams bangs on about his brief return to Take That rejuvenating him creatively, it's "interesting" that Different is his second single in a row to feature penmanship from Take That overlord Gary Barlow. It's as if pop's very own boring uncle won't let Williams move on unless he has a say in where he goes next, which if the epic Different is anything to go by, appears to be straight back to therapy. "This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so", he strains on the chorus over a musical backing last heard on an Embrace album. Maybe Barlow's new muse can be Christopher Maloney and we can have Rudebox-era Robbie back.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/frank-ocean">Frank Ocean</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/ellie-goulding">Ellie Goulding</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/girlsaloud">Girls Aloud</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jls">JLS</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michaelcragg">Michael Cragg</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Their shrewd decision-making is underlined by the choice of live guest for tonight's Christmas blowout, the elusive Berlin producer Frank Timm AKA Soundstream. Like many a Panorama Bar regular, Timm was educated at the school of Hard Wax (the famed Berlin record shop). His Soundstream productions – issued on his own label with retro labels harking back to house music's original 80s heyday – display the kind of deadly precision common to every producer who came up through the Hard Wax route. He's joined on the night by Night Slugs' own Girl Unit and Jam City; with Bok Bok and L-Vis 1990 going back to back.</p><p><strong><em>XOYO, EC2, Sat</em></strong></p><p><em>Sam Richards</em></p><h2>Nest: End Of The World Party, Leeds</h2><p>Being of no fixed abode, Leeds party Nest perhaps has less to lose when the world ends, possibly later this week. They are facing the potential apocalypse shoulders back and chest out, forgoing their chance to dig a bunker in their last weekend and offering a celebration of house music old and new instead. Growing from hosting back rooms to one-off parties in unusual locations as well as regular club spaces, the two-and-a-half-year-old night has displayed a clear affection for vintage house sounds. Previous guests have included Mood II Swing's Lem Springsteen, and Detroit's Terence Parker plays a rescheduled date in January. Their last session was held in a previously unutilised area beneath a shopping centre, but tonight they move to Holbeck Underground Ballroom, a warehouse on the city's outskirts. Guests are legendary Detroit figure Mike Huckaby and relative newcomer Darius Syrossian.</p><p><strong><em>Holbeck Underground Ballroom, 1 Bath Road</em></strong></p><p><em>Marc Rowlands</em></p><h2>End Of The World Party, Chatham</h2><p>Whether or not the world really does end on Friday, it hasn't stopped a stack of celebratory parties – like Nest's similarly fatalistic offering in West Yorkshire – attempting to see the world off in style. But, should an asteroid storm suddenly cascade from the heavens, the labyrinth of tunnels contained within Fort Amherst should provide some decent protection. And there are plenty of quality sounds to keep the 500-odd apocalypse survivors' spirits up. It's a huge cross-genre lineup spanning house, breaks, basslines and dubstep supplied by a very decent smattering of names-to-watch for next year. Top of the pile is Redlight, who has enjoyed a very solid 2012 with bass-heavy house hits such as Get Out Of My Head and Lost In Your Love. Also braving the end of civilisation as we know it are Digital Soundboy's dubstep crossover maestro Breakage, house and electro showstopper FOAMO, plus Roska and Jamie George with their funky twist on drum'n'bass. The dress code is "survival wear", obviously.</p><p><strong><em>Fort Amherst, Dock Road, Fri</em></strong></p><p><em>John Mitchell</em></p><h2>Hypercolour Xmas Showcase, London</h2><p>Hypercolour is the canny UK house label that's given a crucial to leg-up to the likes of Glimpse, Huxley and particularly Maya Jane Coles (who repays the favour by headlining this Xmas bash). The big draw tonight, however, is the live debut of Dense & Pika, a hitherto mysterious duo whose series of self-released 12-inches have piqued everyone's interest. Rumour has it they have connections with Planet E, but unless they actually turn out to be Carl Craig and Moodymann, perhaps they should keep their balaclavas on to preserve the mystery.</p><p><strong><em>The Sidings, E1, Sat</em></strong></p><p><em>SR</em></p><h2>Blitzed, Glasgow</h2><p>The second outing of Blitzed invites its patrons to party like it's 1942, but without any fears of a direct hit from a doodlebug, imminent Nazi invasion or the prospect of tinned fish and Spam for Christmas dinner. House band Winston And The Churchills provide the swinging soundtrack for suitably attired Brylcreem boys, zoot-suited spivs and GI Joes, while the Blitzed DJs drop some vintage platters by Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw, including festive numbers from the 40s.</p><p><strong><em>The Old Hairdresser, Renfield Lane, Sat</em></strong></p><p><em>Patric Baird</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/clubs">Clubbing</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnmitchell">John Mitchell</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samrichards">Sam Richards</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patricbaird">Patric Baird</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marcrowlands">Marc Rowlands</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Based on Johanna Spyri's much-loved but rather dated story of a girl who goes to live in the Alps and befriends a goatherd and a disabled child, this script by Andrew Pollard takes a clever comic approach. It's one that's tried and tested: the show was first produced at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough in 2008 and received a Best Children's Play nomination in the TMA awards. With the story told through the eyes of the goats, it should entertain modern audiences.</p><p><strong><em>Egg Theatre, Sat to 13 Jan</em></strong></p><p><em>Lyn Gardner</em></p><h2>Cinderellas, London</h2><p>Cinderella certainly seems to be the panto of choice this year, with plenty of variety on offer. The most subversive will be <strong>Midnight's Pumpkin</strong>, at the BAC, SW11 (to 13 Jan), which will get the audience donning dancing shoes to impress Prince Charming. At London's newest theatre, the St James, SW1 (to 26 Jan), <strong>Cinderella: A Fairytale</strong> is given a sweet storytelling spin by Tobacco Factory Theatre as a bullied Cinders finds solace in woodland birds. <strong>Cinderella The Midnight Princess</strong> at the Rose Theatre, Kingston (to 6 Jan) offers the familiar ingredients, though Charles Way's adaptation adds a struggling court composer called Mozart; while <strong>Cinderella</strong> (Lyric Hammersmith, W6, to 5 Jan) has Mel Giedroyc as the wicked stepmother.</p><p><em>Mark Cook</em></p><h2>Arabian Nights, Salford</h2><p>Dominic Cooke's adaptation graced the Young Vic more than a decade ago and these retellings of familiar stories such as Sinbad The Sailor, Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves and The Story Of The Little Beggar have proved popular ever since. Indeed, there are a couple more adaptations in London this winter. In truth, rather like Carol Ann Duffy's Grimm Tales, the power of any revival is in the staging and the discovery of a theatrical language to match the simple power of the stories themselves. What really gives these tales – which encompass the miraculous and the ribald – their emotional punch is the clever framing device: the storyteller is new bride Shahrazad, who is telling the stories to stay alive. She will only keep her head if her husband wants to hear the next story – there's something genuinely at stake.</p><p><strong><em>The Lowry, to 12 Jan</em></strong></p><p><em>LG</em></p><h2>Pantos for adults, London</h2><p>One pantomime this year boasts a historic farewell: positively the final appearance of Lily Savage – or so says one Paul O'Grady of his "blonde bombsite" alter ego – in <strong>Aladdin: A Wish Come True</strong> as Widow Twankey at The 02, SE10 (to 5 Jan). The title role is played by Jon Lee (pictured), ex of S Club 7 but more recently a star of Les Misérables and Jersey Boys. More camp goings-on can be found in <strong>Get Aladdin</strong> at the Landor Theatre, SW9 (to 6 Jan). It's from Above The Stag, so expect more innuendo than you can poke a festive sausage at; it's most definitely not for the kiddies. In a similar, er, vein, at the Leicester Square Theatre, WC2 (to 20 Jan), there's also <strong>Dick!</strong> which follows the journey of hero Dick and his cat Dave as they try to make their way in old London town. Characters include Queen Runt, Alice and Sofondo Cox. Ridiculously rude adult fun.</p><p><em>MC</em></p><h2>The Importance Of Being Earnest, Scarborough</h2><p>George Bernard Shaw did not care much for Oscar Wilde's comedy of manners. He declared that its convoluted plot and witty dialogue "leave me with a sense of having wasted my evening". You can't please everyone, but this play has proved considerably more enduring with audiences than most of Shaw's plays. It makes a welcome reappearance in Scarborough in this revival by Chris Monks in which the tale of young love, lost babies and handbags should provide much-needed entertainment for those who find most festive theatre a bit of a bore. Wilde's play can sparkle as brightly as any Christmas tree.</p><p><strong><em>Stephen Joseph Theatre, Tue to 5 Jan</em></strong></p><p><em>LG</em></p><h2>The Last March, Exeter</h2><p>It's been a good year for Exeter theatre with the successful delivery of a first project by the new Kaleider initiative, which will deliver productions in non-theatre spaces to the city over the next three years, plus the feeling that the city's cosy Bikeshed space is beginning to make a real impact as it encourages young companies from the region and beyond. Tinder hails from Portsmouth and will be offering an alternative Christmas show with this tragicomic retelling of the story of Captain Scott and his doomed attempt to beat the Norwegian explorer, Admundsen, to the South Pole. Expect lots of snow but very little tinsel. The company takes a comic approach to a story of heroism, the foolhardy and the very English, all told with pots of tea and absolutely no huskies.</p><p><strong><em>The Bikeshed Theatre, Tue to 12 Jan</em></strong></p><p><em>LG</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre">Theatre</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/markcook">Mark Cook</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lyngardner">Lyn Gardner</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The <strong>Royal Ballet</strong> is making an interesting break with tradition by opening a new triple bill three days before Christmas (Royal Opera House, WC2, 22 Dec to 11 Jan), offering its audiences a grown-up alternative to sugary magic and snowflakes. The centrepiece is Jerome Robbins's rarely seen ballet In The Night, a trio of subtly nuanced romantic, erotic duets set to the music of Chopin. Dream casting includes Sarah Lamb, Marianela Nú��ez and Alina Cojocaru. Opening the evening is a revival of Mikhail Fokine's exotic fairytale The Firebird, and concluding it is Raymonda Act III (top), a ballet of exemplary imperial crackle with Cojocaru and Zenaida Yanowsky alternating in the ballerina role.</p><p>At the other end of the dance spectrum is <strong>Legacy The Return</strong>, the latest show by hip-hop company Boy Blue (Jerwood DanceHouse, Ipswich, to 23 Dec). It advertises itself as a family-friendly spectacle and is directed by choreographers Kenrick Sandy and Michael Asante. Finally, tonight sees the John Scott Dance Company perform Kyle Abraham's group piece <strong>The Outsider </strong>for Dance Ireland (Project Arts Centre, Dublin). Abraham himself dances two solos including an extract from Live! The Realist MC which re-imagines Pinocchio as a B-boy.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/dance">Dance</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/judithmackrell">Judith Mackrell</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Founded in 1995, the non-commercial festival draws on winter festivals past, with around 2,000 lantern-bearing revellers making their way through the city's streets and down to the sea. The procession closes with fireworks and fancy pyrotechnics, as spectators watch from the pebbles.</p><p><strong><em>North Street to Madeira Drive, Fri</em></strong><em> </em></p><p><em>Iain Aitch</em></p><h2><a href="http://montol.co.uk" title="">Montol Eve</a>, Penzance</h2><p>Reviving an ancient local tradition, this relatively new festival marks the death and rebirth of the sun with burning lanterns set atop high points, rivers of fire and, erm, a tea dance. The festival, which celebrates custom and history yet does not take itself too seriously, runs from morning until night, with craft events and bands building up to a late-night torchlit procession through the streets of Penzance. The Turkey Rhubarb Guise Band and Penzance Youth String Orchestra provide the musical entertainment, with fancy dress, Christmas singalongs and dancing. You may even become mayor for the evening if you dress right and get lucky.</p><p><strong><em>St John's Hall, Fri</em></strong></p><p><em>IA</em></p><h2><a href="http://balticmill.com" title="">Festival Of The Apocalypse</a>, Gateshead</h2><p>As mentioned elsewhere in this issue, we're all done for come Friday.

Physicist David Korowicz will explore how we can "wisely and creatively adapt" to our post-growth age, while trombonist John Kenny casts off the old days and heralds the new dawn with his sunrise and sunset opuses on the carnyx (it's an iron-age battle horn). Meanwhile, ongoing installation The Encampment Of Eternal Hope features Triffid-esque tents and Survival Exercise Classes, and will last into the new year – assuming there is one.</p><p><strong><em>BALTIC, Fri and 22 Dec</em></strong></p><p><em>Colette Bernhardt</em></p><h2>Out & about</h2><p><a href="http://visitleeds.co.uk" title=""><strong>Christkindlmarkt</strong></a><strong>, Leeds, Sat & Sun</strong></p><p>Leeds's answer to Manchester's German Christmas Market shuts up shop after this weekend, so this is a last chance to combine Bavarian grub, booze and last-minute gift buying.</p><p><em>Millennium Square</em></p><p><a href="http://bridgewater-hall.co.uk" title=""><strong>Christmas Carolling</strong></a><strong>, Manchester, Mon</strong></p><p>This is a chance to belt out classics like The First Noël and Good King Wenceslas in the company of Russell Watson.</p><p><em>Bridgewater Hall</em></p><p><strong>A Christmas Celebration, London, Wed & Thu</strong></p><p>The award-winning Westminster Cathedral Choir will be singing classic Christmas songs with celebrity readers including Baroness Warsi and Peep Show's Alan Johnson AKA Patterson Joseph.</p><p><em>Westminster Cathedral, SW1</em></p><p><a href="http://visitplymouth.co.uk" title=""><strong>Winter Ice Rink</strong></a><strong>, Plymouth, to 24 Feb</strong></p><p>Special events for kids, skating lessons for all abilities, plus the potentially messy Breakfast And Skate With Santa.</p><p><em>The Piazza</em></p><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iainaitch">Iain Aitch</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/colette-bernhardt">Colette Bernhardt</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The measure removes all prospect of a territorial compromise in any future peace negotiation. Annexation of the Heights, where 6,600 Jews live in 31 settlements, will be popular with the overwhelming majority of Israelis.</p><p>Israel's annexation in all but name of the Golan Heights is Mr Begin's way of poking a sharp stick in the eye of President Assad of Syria when the President's other eye is being poked by the Muslim Brotherhood. The move will have wide support in Israel, first because the Heights are deemed essential to the security of the settlements in the valley below, and second because Mr Assad is thus shown the penalty of not entering into peace negotiations (not that he would get the Heights back if he did).</p><p>Syria and the Soviet Union do not have the type of treaty which regards an attack on one as an attack on the other, but their treaty of October 1980 is enough to ensure that the stick is poked in Mr Brezhnev's eye as well. The two countries resolved that "in cases of the emergence of situations jeopardising peace or the security of one of the parties" they would "enter without delay into contact with each other with a view to cooperating in order to remove the threat." Entering without delay is not the same as mounting an attack on Israel. Nor can a change in notional status which leaves things unmoved on the ground in itself jeopardise the security of Syria. Nonetheless the Israeli Government has clearly decided to keep up the momentum allowed to it by the collapse of comprehensive peace moves from Europe and Riyadh, and the tension in the region is therefore fractionally increased.</p><p>Any Israeli government has a diverse constituency to satisfy and Mr Begin's is no exception. The withdrawal from Sinai due in April has antagonised the Gush Emunim and other nationalist groups who have threatened physically to obstruct it. Annexation of the Golan may therefore have been designed partly as an emollient to Sinai settlers. Until President Mubarak has retrieved his territory he in turn will not wish to prejudice the deal by strenuous opposition to the Golan annexation.</p><p>What the annexation does is to signal Israel's commitment to its own terms and only its own terms for securing peace. They include the effective control of all the territory seized in 1967 with the exception of the Sinai desert. The Sinai withdrawal is unpopular even with members of the Government, but as the price of making peace with Israel it is just acceptable. But were President Assad to make the journey to the Knesset himself he would not get the Golan Heights: and the stark truth is that they are more important defensively to Israel than they are agriculturally to him.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel">Israel</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria">Syria</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/egypt">Egypt</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa">Africa</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
